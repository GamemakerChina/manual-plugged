To load a sound, press the <strong>Load Sound</strong> button to the right of the sound name. A file selector dialogue pops up in which you can select the sound file. This should be either a <span class="inline">WAV</span>, an <span class="inline">MP3</span> file or an <span class="inline">OGG</span> file. In general <span class="inline">*.wav</span> are used for the short sound effects as even though they are generally larger files they will play instantaneously due to the fact that they do not need any type of decoding for playing. <span class="inline">*.mp3</span> or <span class="inline">*.ogg</span> format files should be used for background music or for sound effects that are longer or larger in size. These files are much smaller than a wave file would be but have a small CPU overhead as they have to be decoded before being played.</p><p>Once you have loaded your file you can preview the sound by using the play button which will loop it continuously. This is very handy as it means you can make changes to the volume using the slider at the bottom of the window and hear what the effect it will have on the sound. There is a stop button too, so you can stop the preview at any time.</p><p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_tip.hts"><span class="tip">TIP</span></span>&nbsp;Use&nbsp;<a href="../IDE_Tools/The_Inspector.htm">The Inspector</a> to view the waveform for the selected sound.</p><p>The sound window also has other options which are explained below:</p><p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Name And File</span><span data-close-text="true">Name And File</span></a></p><div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down"><p class="dropspot">Here you can click the <em>Open</em>&nbsp;button to open the file explorer and choose an audio file to load.

These are the attributes that will be set when you export your game and will affect how the sound is&nbsp;played back at runtime. For sound effects (<span class="inline">WAV</span> format) you will want them to be <em>uncompressed</em> so that they play quickly and don't require decoding. Note that using this option will convert your audio to the <span class="inline">WAV</span> format during compile time&nbsp;(however if the attributes set in the Sound Editor match the attributes of the source&nbsp;<span class="inline">WAV</span> file, then it&nbsp;will simply be copied over).&nbsp;For <span class="inline">OGG</span> and <span class="inline">MP3</span>, you'd generally want one of the other three options available.</p><p class="dropspot"><em>Compressed</em> audio will force all your sound files (irrespective of whether they are <span class="inline">WAV</span> or <span class="inline">MP3</span>) to be compressed down to Ogg Vorbis <span class="inline">OGG</span> format files for <em>all</em> platforms (however, if the source audio is already <span class="inline">OGG</span>&nbsp;it will simply be copied over without being recompressed if the <strong>Conversion</strong> option is set to <strong>Automatic</strong>). These sounds are smaller on disc, but will have a slight CPU overhead due to the need to be uncompressed and loaded into memory before being played, so you should keep that in mind if you wish to use <a class="tooltip" title="Compression is the use of mathematical algorithms to reduce the size of a file. This is used in particular for audio and image files, where formats like JPG (image) and MP3 (audio) are compressed formats. Compression usually results is much smaller file sizes, but with some data loss which may or may not be noticable depending on the type and strength of the compression used. Uncompressed formats would be BMP (image) or WAV (audio), which have larger file sizes, but no data loss.">compression</a> in an already CPU intensive game.</p><p class="dropspot">You can mitigate this CPU overhead somewhat by choosing to <em>uncompress on load</em>, which will place all the sounds into the device memory for faster playback, at the expense of increased memory use.</p><p class="dropspot">If you have chosen compressed audio, you can then also choose to have your sound <em>streamed from disk</em>. A streamed sound will be one that is uncompressed and played in real time, streamed from the disk rather than loaded into memory. Streaming is ideal for music as it reduces the one-off overhead of uncompressing the whole file -&nbsp;which may cause a pause in the game -&nbsp;but is not recommended for simple sound effects where the hit on the CPU is much less. If you select streamed audio, you will <em>not</em> be able to assign the sound to an <a href="../Settings/Audio_Groups.htm">Audio Group</a>&nbsp;and this option will be disabled, as streamed sounds are not packaged in the same way as other sounds and you have full control over when they are loaded, played and unloaded using code. These sounds will, however, be assigned to the default audio group&nbsp;<span class="inline2"><a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Audio/Audio_Groups/audiogroup_default.htm">audiogroup_default</a></span>.</p><p class="dropspot">It is important to note that when targeting the HTML5 platform, streamed audio will not play when the play request does not directly originate from a user interaction (i.e: a touch event, etc.). However, since <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> queues up click events and only handles them on the next frame, it is impossible to play streamed audio without the browser blocking it. To get around this, any HTML5 game run will treat all streamed audio as unstreamed in the engine, with the exception of streamed audio not being preloaded.</p><p class="dropspot">What this means is that if your game is running on a browser, and - for example - you have 10 music tracks that are all set as streamed <span class="inline">mp3</span> files, all 10 will be initialised like unstreamed audio would, but they won't be decoded immediately before the game loads, unlike normal streamed audio which would get preloaded/decoded immediately during the load screen phase.</p><p class="dropspot">While this bypasses the issue and prevents any huge increase in initial load times, it does mean that it may result in a state where your game has loaded, but certain streamed sounds may still be downloading or decoding. To deal with this you can use the GML function <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Audio/audio_sound_is_playable.htm"><span class="inline">audio_sound_is_playable()</span></a>&nbsp;which checks to see if a given sound can actually be played. On HTML5 this will return <span class="inline">false</span> if the sound is not fully loaded or decoded yet, and <span class="inline">true</span> if it is and can be played (on all other platforms it will always return true).</p></div><p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down3" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Target Options</span><span data-close-text="true">Target Options</span></a></p><div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down3"><p class="dropspot">The Target Options panel is where you set the conversion rates for your game.

Generally the default settings of 16 bit quality (or <a class="tooltip" title="The bit depth refers to the number of bits in each sample of an audio file.
