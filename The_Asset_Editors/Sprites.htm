When checked - if the origin is not one of the default settings and is not locked in the sprite - then its position will be scaled to match the change to the size of the sprite. When un-checked, no scaling will be applied to the origin. If the origin is not a custom value or is locked, then it will be grayed out and unavailable.

For desktop platforms this may not be too important, but when you start to develop for mobile or web the proper management of your image assets (textures) becomes very important as poorly managed textures can have detrimental effect on your game, causing performance issues.</p><p class="dropspot">The <strong>Tile Horizontally</strong> and <strong>Tile Vertically</strong> check boxes are, by default, not normally checked as most times you do not want to tile sprites. However, in certain circumstances you may wish them to tile, meaning that you should check these options, especially if you are going to be scaling the view or room as scaling can introduce artefacts into the graphics of a game if the texture page is not generated properly.</p><p class="dropspot" id="separate_texture_page">If your sprite is going to be used as a texture map in a 3D game, then you should check the <strong>Separate Texture Page</strong> box and the sprite will be given a texture page all of its own (note that each sub-image will also get its own texture page, so if your sprite has 10 images you will generate 10 texture pages). This will increase the texture memory needs of your game and so great care must be taken when using this option. Also note that in general if your sprite is using this option for 3D, then the textures should be a power of 2 (i.e.:&nbsp;128x128, 256x256, 512x512, etc.). For more information read&nbsp;<a href="../Settings/Texture_Information/Texture_Pages.htm">Texture Pages</a>.</p><p class="dropspot">If you mark your sprite as needing a separate texture page, you can set whether that texture page is <a href="../Settings/Texture_Information/Dynamic_Textures.htm">dynamic</a> or not.</p><p class="dropspot">The next option is to enable <strong>Pre-Multiplied Alpha</strong> for the sprite images. When enabled, this will pre-multiply the alpha of all sub-images of the sprite. This is normally only necessary drawing sprites to surfaces, or for some specific special effects. For normal sprite use you should not see any noticeable difference between the normal sprite and the pre-multiplied one.</p><p class="dropspot">We also have an <strong>Edge Filtering</strong> option. This option is specifically for when you have <a class="tooltip" title="Linear interpolation involves estimating a new value by connecting two adjacent known values with a straight line.

Enabling this will filter the edge pixels to take on the colour of the nearest full alpha sprite pixel and so blend the interpolated pixels without the halo that was present previously.</p><p class="dropspot">Finally, you can chose the <strong>texture group</strong> that you wish the sprite resource to belong to. Basically, a texture group (previously defined in the <a href="../Settings/Texture_Groups.htm">Texture Group Manager</a>) is something that you can set up so that all the image resources that you need for specific rooms or levels of your game can be stored together. So, for example, you can have all your level 1 images in one texture group, all your level 2 images in another etc... and <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> will try to place all those grouped resources on the same texture page to reduce texture page swapping while your game is running on the chosen target platform.</p><div class="dropspotnote"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"><span class="note">NOTE</span></span>&nbsp;This may not always be necessary and the performance increase from this method will depend on whether the target device is CPU bound or GPU bound.</div><p class="dropspot">You can find out more about texture pages <a href="../Settings/Texture_Information/Texture_Pages.htm">here</a>.</p><ul class="dropspotlist"></ul><p class="dropspot">&nbsp;</p></div><p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down11" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Collision Mask</span><span data-close-text="true">Collision Mask</span></a></p><div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down11"><p class="dropspot">All sprites have a <strong>collision mask</strong> which corresponds to the area of the sprite that will be used to detect collisions when the sprite is assigned to an instance. You can first set the <strong>Mode</strong> for the collision mask, which can be one of the following:</p><ul class="dropspotlist"><li class="dropspot"><strong>Automatic</strong>: <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> will calculate the collision mask automatically based on the sprite alpha values (this will depend on the Tolerance setting explained below).</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Full Image</strong>: The mask will be calculated with it's bounds being the same as the left, right, top and bottom bounds of the sprite.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Manual</strong>: Selecting this means that you wish to set the bounds of the collision mask using the input values for left, right, top and bottom.</li></ul><p class="dropspot">Apart from the collision mask Mode, there are also various <strong>types</strong> of collision mask which you can choose from the drop down menu:</p><ul class="dropspotlist"><li class="dropspot"><strong>Rectangle</strong>: A simple rectangular collision mask. This is the fastest to resolve when used in your project.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Rotated Rectangle</strong>: This is a simple rectangular collision mask which will rotate along with the <span class="inline">image_angle</span> value of the instance with the sprite assigned. This is slower to resolve than the regular rectangular collision mask, but faster than a precise collision mask.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Ellipse</strong>: Creates an elliptical collision mask. This is slower to resolve than the rectangular mask.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Diamond</strong>: Creates a "diamond" collision mask. This is slower to resolve and generates more CPU overhead than both the rectangular and ellipitical masks.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Precise</strong>: This creates a precise collision mask based on the outline of the sprite. If the sprite has multiple sub-images, then this will be a <em>composite</em> of the edges of <em>all</em> the sub-images placed over each other. Note that the precise mask will be clipped to the <a class="tooltip" title="For sprites, the bounding-box is the name given to the edges of the area that collisions will initially be detected in, and it doesn't have to be the same size as the sprite it's being applied to.

Note that the precise mask will be clipped to the <a class="tooltip" title="For sprites, the bounding-box is the name given to the edges of the area that collisions will initially be detected in, and it doesn't have to be the same size as the sprite it's being applied to.

This is by far the slowest type of collision mask to resolve and should be avoided except in very, very specific and infrequent cases.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Spine Collision Mesh</strong>: Apart from Rectangle, this is the only selectable option for Spine sprites. It enables more precise collision checking against the mesh in the sprite.</li></ul><p class="dropspot">The following image illustrates the different mask options:</p><p class="dropspot"><img alt="Collisions" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/bbox_image.png">The collision checking options are very important ones for your game, as they will directly influence how your objects interact and how your game runs, with the wrong settings even having a negative impact on the over all performance. Why is that? Well, whenever two instances meet, and both instances have a valid mask, a collision event is generated by checking the overlap of the bounding box <em>and&nbsp;</em>the mask, which can either be precise or not, and adapted to the image index or not. Below is an image to illustrate this:</p><p class="dropspot"><img alt="Different collisions and how they are resolved" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/basic_collisions_image.png"></p><p class="dropspot">Beneath the collision mask setting, you have the <strong>alpha tolerance</strong> slider, which indicates the tolerance for creating the mask with respect to the transparency of the sprites pixels - with a higher tolerance pixels that are partially transparent are left outside the mask, while with a lower tolerance the mask will take into account those pixels. This influences both the bounding box (when not set to manual) and the mask for precise collision checking.</p><p class="dropspot">Finally you can set the <strong>Bounding Box</strong> limits for the mask. The bounding box is the name given to the rectangular area that the sprite mask fits in. Only pixels inside this bounding box are used for the mask and will be involved in collision checking, and by default this is automatically computed, taking the alpha tolerance into account. If you have "precise (per frame)" checked then this will be separate for each sub-image too. When setting it yourself, you can input the values in the boxes for left, right top and bottom, or you can click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21">&nbsp;in the sprite preview window and drag to "draw" it over the sprite. Note that when "drawing" the bounding box, the mask is automatically generated to fit within the end values, and the bounding box can "clip" the mask.</p><p class="dropspot">It is worth noting that if you go to the Preview window, you can adjust the collision mask using the "handles" found in each corner. Clicking and dragging these will adjust the collision mask just the same as inputing values for the bounding box would.</p><p class="dropspot">&nbsp;</p></div><p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down21" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Nine Slice</span><span data-close-text="true">Nine Slice</span></a></p><div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down21"><p class="dropspot"><strong><span data-keyref="Nine Slicing">Nine Slicing</span></strong>&nbsp;(also known as 9-slicing) is a technique used to scale rectangular images for preserving details, making them retain their original form after scaling.

So, for example, if you set the sprite to use 10 "frames per second" and then set the <span class="inline">image_speed</span> to 0.5, the game will draw the sprite at half speed - 5 frames per second. Conversely, if we set the <span class="inline">image_speed</span> for the same sprite to 2, in the game it will be drawn animated twice as fast - 20 frames per second. Note that the frame speed can also be set in <a href="Image_Editor.htm">The Image Editor</a>.</p><p class="dropspot">&nbsp;</p></div><p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down13" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Sprite Origin</span><span data-close-text="true">Sprite Origin</span></a></p><div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down13"><p class="dropspot">The top bar of the sprite editor contains the <strong>sprite origin</strong> properties.

You can also set the origin manually by clicking <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png">&nbsp;in the sprite preview image which will move the origin marker cross to the point you clicked, or by inputting different values for x and y in the corresponding boxes. Note that you can even set an origin outside the area of sprite by using negative numbers (for left and up) or positive numbers larger than the sprite width and height (for right and down), which can be very useful when dealing with objects that need to draw composite sprites.</p><p class="dropspot">&nbsp;</p></div><p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down14" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Zoom Controls</span><span data-close-text="true">Zoom Controls</span></a></p><div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down14"><p class="dropspot">To the top right of the Preview window you have the <strong>zoom controls</strong>.
