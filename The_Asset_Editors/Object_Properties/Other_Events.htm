That's when this event is triggered, right at the end of the animation when the sub image index shows that the last frame has been reached. This event is really useful for many things, for example an explosion object where you can set the instance to destroy itself when the last frame of the animation is reached.</p><p class="dropspot">&nbsp;</p></div><p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down8" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Animation Update</span><span data-close-text="true">Animation Update</span></a></p><div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down8"><p class="dropspot">This event is designed only for use with the <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sprites/Skeletal_Animation/Skeletal_Animation.htm">Skeletal Animation Functions</a>.&nbsp;It's triggered in an object which has a skeletal animation sprite assigned to it, whenever that sprite is drawn in that object.
