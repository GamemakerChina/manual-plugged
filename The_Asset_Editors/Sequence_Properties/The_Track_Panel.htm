This will open up the <strong>Colour Picker</strong> where you can choose which colour to use for the key tracks in the Dope Sheet.</p><p>Each asset in the track editor can also have a set of <a class="tooltip" title="A track that has been assigned to an asset track in the track panel and that changes a single parameter for the asset track it's linked to, like the position, or the image index.">parameter tracks</a> added to it. These tracks are what control the various different properties (parameters) that can be modified for the track over time. The different parameters available are covered in depth in the section on "<strong>Adding Parameter Tracks</strong>" further down this page, but to give you an idea of what's available here is a brief list:</p><ul class="colour"><li><strong>All Assets</strong>: <em>Position</em> and <em>Rotation</em>.</li><li><strong>Sounds</strong>: <em>Pitch</em> and <em>Volume as well as Bus and Audio Effects.</em></li><li><strong>Sequences</strong>: <em>Origin</em> and <em>Scale</em>.</li><li><strong>Particle Systems</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Colour Multiply,</em>&nbsp;<em>Origin</em> and&nbsp;<em>Scale.</em></li><li><strong>Sprites and Objects</strong>: <em>Origin</em>, <em>Scale</em>, <em>Image Index</em>, <em>Image Speed</em>, and <em>Colour Multiply</em>.</li><li><strong>Text</strong>: <em>Origin, Scale, Colour Multiply, Character Spacing, Frame Size, Line Spacing, and Paragraph Spacing as well as SDF Effects.</em></li></ul><p>To add a parameter track in the editor you can enable "<strong>Automatically Record Changes</strong>" <img alt="Record Changes Icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Seq_Record.png">&nbsp;in the Track Panel, which will then add parameter keys for any changes you make to an asset in the Canvas at the current playhead position, as shown here:</p><p><img alt="Adding A Parameter Key To An Asset In The Canvas" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Canvas_Add_Keys.gif">Alternatively, you can click the "<strong>Add Parameter Track</strong>" <img alt="Add Parameter Track Button" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Add_Param.png">&nbsp;button, which will open up a menu showing you the different options available:</p><p><img alt="Adding A Parameter Track To An Asset In The Track Panel" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Track_Editor_Add_Parameter.png">Selecting any option from this menu, or recording directly from the IDE, will create one or more parameter tracks underneath the main asset track, and also add a <a class="tooltip" title="A parameter key (also called a keyframe) is a point on the timeline in the dope sheet where a change in a parameter value is defined.">parameter key</a> to the Dope Sheet, coloured the same as the main asset track colour:</p><p><img alt="Parameter Tracks In The Track Panel And Dope Sheet" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Track_Editor_ParameterTracks.png">Once you add a parameter track to your main asset track, the dope sheet will have a coloured bar to show the length of the asset track in frames, and there will be <strong>parameter keys</strong> (keyframes) added at the points where you want a change in the parameter to occur. These keys can be seen in the above image as simple "dots" on a frame. When a track has parameter keys like this, the parameter they refer to will be interpolated (using&nbsp;<a class="tooltip" title="Linear interpolation involves estimating a new value by connecting two adjacent known values with a straight line. You can then get the interpolated value by checking any point along the line. In graphics, linear interpolation refers to a basic method of smoothing pixel edges.">linear interpolation</a>) by default between each of the points shown. For example, if you have a rotation parameter and at frame 0 it is set to 90° then at frame 30 it is 180°, then at frame 15 it will be 135°. You can actually see the change in values over time by selecting the parameter track and then "scrubbing" the playhead in the dope sheet:</p><p><img alt="Interpolating Between Parameter Keys" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Track_Editor_Changing_Parameter.gif"></p><p>Note that for all parameter tracks you can disable the default linear interpolation between different keys from the right mouse button <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png">&nbsp;menu on the parameter track, which means that transitions between parameter values will occur <em>instantly</em> on the given frame rather than gradually over time:</p><p><img alt="Disable Linear Interpolation On Parameter Track" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Track_Editor_RMB_Menu_Params.png">Apart from being able to choose the transition type for parameter tracks, the RMB menu also offers you the following options:</p><ul class="colour"><li><strong>Cut</strong>, <strong>Copy</strong>, and <strong>Paste</strong>: These options permit you to cut/copy/paste asset or parameter tracks.</li><li><strong>Duplicate Track(s)</strong>: This will create a duplicate of the currently selected track(s). If this is an asset track it will also duplicate the parameter tracks associated with it.</li><li><strong>Delete Track(s)</strong>: This will delete the selected track or tracks. If you delete an asset track, then the parameter tracks associated with it will also be removed, however you can delete parameter tracks individually.</li><li><strong>Group</strong>: Using this option on an empty space in the Track Panel will create a group folder which you can then use to help keep your assets in a more orderly format. You can add an asset to a group by simply clicking on it and dragging it onto the folder. If you have already selected a track or tracks, then using this option will not only create a group folder, but it will add the track(s) to it.</li><li><strong>Rename</strong>: You can use this option to rename any asset track or group folder.</li></ul><p>An important feature of asset and parameter tracks is the ability to <strong>parent</strong> tracks and groups. If you drag an asset track onto another one in the track panel, the first asset becomes a <strong>child</strong> of the asset it was dropped on, which in turn becomes the <strong>parent</strong>. All parameter tracks assigned to the parent asset track will then automatically be applied to the child asset tracks, so you can have multiple sprites (for example) all using a single position asset track to move:<img alt="Parent And Child Sprites Share Parameters" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Track_Editor_Parenting.gif" style="cursor:nwse-resize">The same can be done using groups. You can create a group folder by clicking the button at the bottom of the track panel and then drag the asset tracks you want to be grouped together on the group folder. These assets will still retain their own parameter tracks, but you can then give additional parameter tracks to the group and all the assets in the group will be affected by these parameter tracks as well as their own individual parameter tracks.</p><p>When working with the track panel the usual keyboard shortcuts can be used too, i.e.: <img alt="CONTROL Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55">&nbsp;/ <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55">&nbsp;and the left mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21">&nbsp;to select one or more tracks in any order, <img alt="Shift Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png" width="55">&nbsp;and the left mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21">&nbsp;to select consecutive tracks, and you can also&nbsp;cut, copy and paste them using the&nbsp;<img alt="CONTROL Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55">&nbsp;/ <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55">&nbsp;+"<span class="inline">X</span>", &nbsp;<img alt="CONTROL Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55">&nbsp;/ <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55">&nbsp;+ "<span class="inline">C</span>" and &nbsp;<img alt="CONTROL Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55">&nbsp;/ <img alt="CMD Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55"> + "<span class="inline">V</span>" key combinations.</p><p>That's the basics of using the track editor, but below we go into a bit more detail on what each of the different sections are for and how to use them:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Change Orientation</span><span data-close-text="true">Change Orientation</span></a></p><div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down"><p class="dropspot">The change orientation button&nbsp;<img alt="Change Orientation Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_ChangeOrientation.png">&nbsp;can be used to change the way the Sequence Editor displays the different sections.

For example, if you move the playhead from frame 0 to frame 10 and then in the canvas move the asset 100 pixels to the right, a parameter track will be added for position, and the parameter keys will be added at frame 0 (the initial position) and at frame 10 (the playhead position) and when you press "Play" on the sequence, the asset will move 100px to the right over ten frames.<br><img alt="Automatically Record Parameter Keys" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Sequences_Auto.gif" style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:25px"></li></ul></div><p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down7" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Visible / Lock Toggles</span><span data-close-text="true">Visible / Lock Toggles</span></a></p><div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down7"><p class="dropspot">Both asset tracks and parameter tracks have a button to toggle track visibility <img alt="Track Visibility Icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Track_Visible.png">&nbsp;and to lock the track <img alt="Track Lock Icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Track_Lock.png">. If you disable the visibility of the track, then it will not be shown when the sequence is run in a room, nor will it be shown in the sequence canvas while testing, and toggling the visibility of an asset track will also toggle the visibility of its parameter tracks. Locking a track simply means that this track will no longer be able to be edited in any way. Note that tracks that are invisible will be drawn faded on the dope sheet, while tracks that are locked will be drawn with an overlay, so you can immediately see what state each track is in:</p><p class="dropspot"><img alt="Locked And Invisible Tracks In The Dope Sheet" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Track_Editor_Locked_And_Visible.png">&nbsp;</p></div><p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down8" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Track Colour</span><span data-close-text="true">Track Colour</span></a></p><div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down8"><p class="dropspot">Each asset track you create will be assigned a random colour by the IDE to make it easier to identify on the Dope Sheet. This colour can be changed at any time by simply clicking the colour bar for the track and then selecting the colour you want to use from the Colour Picker window that opens. Any colour selected for an asset track will automatically be applied to all the parameter tracks associated, however you can then edit the colour of each parameter track individually so it is different if required.

As mentioned earlier on this page, parameter tracks can be of various different types depending on the asset that it is related to. Below is a list of all the different parameter tracks available and what they refer to, as well as the assets that they can be applied to:</p><ul class="dropspotlist"><li class="dropspot"><strong>Position</strong>: This parameter track can be added to any of the four sequence asset types (<em>sprites</em>, <em>objects</em>, <em>sounds, sequences&nbsp;</em>or <em>particle systems</em>) and is used to set the spatial position within the sequence for the asset. It takes an X and a Y value.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Rotation</strong>: Like the position parameter, the rotation parameter is available for <em>all</em> sequence assets and can be used to set the rotation in degrees for the asset. Keep in mind that <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> calculates rotation <em>anti-clockwise</em>, starting with 0° on the right, so 90° is up, 180° is left and 270° is down.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Origin</strong>: The origin parameter is available for <em>sprite</em>, <em>object,</em>&nbsp;<em>sequence</em> and <em>particle system</em> assets and can be used to set the X and Y position of the origin of the asset. Changing the origin will affect how the asset is positioned, rotated and scaled.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Scale</strong>: The scale parameter is available for <em>sprite</em>, <em>object,</em>&nbsp;<em>sequence</em> and <em>particle system</em> assets and is used to set the horizontal and vertical scale of the asset. This will affect how the asset is rendered in the IDE and at runtime, and is calculated as a scalar value, where 100% is the default asset size, 50% would be half size, and 200% would be double the size. Note that you have the possibility of linking the horizontal and vertical scale values by clicking the "link" <img alt="Track Link Icon" height="14" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Track_Link.png" width="14">&nbsp;button. This means that changing one value will automatically change the other too.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Image Index</strong> and <strong>Image Speed</strong>: These parameters are only available for <em>sprite</em> and <em>object</em> assets and can be used to change the current animation frame (see the page on the <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprite_Instance_Variables/image_index.htm">image_index</a>&nbsp;for more information) as well as the current animation speed, which is set using FPS and works the same way as the value you set for the sprite being used in <a href="../Sprites.htm">The Sprite Editor</a>.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Colour Multiply</strong>: This parameter is only available for <em>sprite,</em>&nbsp;<em>object</em> and <em>particle system</em> assets and can be used to change the current blend colour for the asset being drawn. This is the equivalent of setting the <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprite_Instance_Variables/image_blend.htm">image_blend</a>&nbsp;value and any colours set here will be "multiplied" (i.e., blended) with the colour of the sprite, and a value of white (#ffffffff) indicates that no blending should take place. Note that when working with this type of track, you can set the colour by manually typing in the hex value, or you can click the colour swatch to open the <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> Colour Picker. Note that colours are given in <a class="tooltip" title="This is an anacronym for Alpha, Red, Green, Blue, and is used to refer to the colour components specified as a hexadecimal value, eg: #FF53E270, where each set of two digits represents a single component. Breaking down the ARGB example above gives us the following component values: Alpha(FF), Red(53), Green(E2) and Blue(70). ">ARGB</a> format, so you can set a value for alpha using this kind of parameter track (the Colour Picker also permits you to set the alpha value). This would be the equivalent of setting the <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprite_Instance_Variables/image_alpha.htm">image_alpha</a>&nbsp;for the sprite.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Volume</strong>: The volume parameter only applies to <em>sound</em> asset tracks and can be used to set the gain of the sound (the actual sound asset gain won't be changed, as it's essentially an emitter that is used for the asset track in sequences). The volume value is calculated as a percentage, where 0% is no volume and 100% is full volume.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Pitch</strong>: The pitch parameter only applies to <em>sound</em> asset tracks and can be used to set the pitch of the sound (as with volume, the actual sound asset gain won't be changed, as it's essentially an emitter that is used for the asset track in sequences). The pitch value is calculated as a percentage, 100% is the "natural" pitch of the sound, and less than 100% will lower it while greater than 100% will raise it.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>Falloff</strong>: The falloff parameter only applies to <em>sound</em> asset tracks and is currently not implemented.</li><li class="dropspot">There are some additional parameters only available to Text Tracks. Please read&nbsp;<a href="Text_in_Sequences.htm">Text in Sequences</a>&nbsp;for information on them.</li><li class="dropspot">A total of&nbsp;<span data-keyref="Const_Audio_Bus_Max_Effects">8</span> audio effect parameter tracks can be added to sound asset tracks as well as a track for the audio bus that's created specifically for the sound asset track. The audio effects can be any of&nbsp;<span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span>'s built-in&nbsp;<a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Audio/Audio_Effects/Audio_Effects.htm">Audio Effects</a>, except for the equalizer effect.

Once selected the asset track will be created and frames added into the Dope Sheet at the current playhead position.</li><li class="dropspot"><img alt="Duplicate Asset Icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_DuplicateAsset.png">&nbsp;- When you have selected one or more asset tracks in the track editor, clicking this button will duplicate them (along with any parameter tracks they may contain).</li><li class="dropspot"><img alt="Clip Mask Icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_AddClipMask.png">&nbsp;- Clicking this will create a special <strong>clipping mask group</strong> where you can give sprites to use as masks and sprites to be masked. See <a href="Clipping_Masks.htm">here</a> for more information.</li><li class="dropspot"><img alt="Group Folder Icon" height="18" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_AddGroup.png" width="25">&nbsp;- Clicking this will add a new group folder to the track editor, which can then be used to better organise tracks. You can add a track to a group by dragging the track onto the group folder and you can remove it again by dragging it out of the folder. Note that any asset that is added to a group folder will automatically be assigned the folder colour, although you can then edit the track colour for individual tracks so that it is different if required.</li><li class="dropspot"><img alt="Track Delete Icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_DeleteTrack.png">&nbsp;- As you might expect, clicking this will delete the selected track(s). If this is an asset track, then all parameter tracks it contains will also be deleted, although you can use it on selected parameter tracks to delete them on their own without removing the asset tracks they are associated with. If you use this on an empty group folder then the folder will be deleted, however if there are any tracks in the folder you will be shown a warning, as deleting a folder will remove all tracks that are inside of it too.</li></ul></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two further pages with information relating to tracks and parameters that are also of interest, the first is about using <a href="../Animation_Curves.htm">Animation Curve</a> assets to generate parameter tracks, and the second outlines how to create <strong>Clipping Masks</strong>:</p><ul class="colour"><li><a href="Using_Animation_Curves.htm">Using Animation Curves</a></li><li><a href="Clipping_Masks.htm">Clipping Masks</a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="footer"><div class="buttons"><div class="clear"><div style="float:left">Back: <a href="../Sequences.htm">Sequences</a></div><div style="float:right">Next:&nbsp;<a href="Text_in_Sequences.htm">Text in Sequences</a></div></div></div><h5><span data-keyref="Copyright Notice">© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2024 All Rights Reserved</span></h5></div></body></html>
