Layers can be added, removed, and sorted from the Layer&nbsp;Editor, and come in a variety of different types, each with their own set of options and way of working. You aren't limited to the number of each type of layer, and can have multiple tile layers, or path layers, or instance layers, etc. Each type of layer has its own <strong>properties window</strong> where you can set different things depending on the layer type. You can also toggle the layer's visibility, with invisible layers <em>not</em> being processed at runtime (but you can make them visible again at any time using the function <span class="inline3_func"><a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/General_Layer_Functions/layer_set_visible.htm">layer_set_visible</a></span>).</p><p><img alt="Room Layers" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Room_Layers.png">The image above shows the Layer Editor, with the current layers listed at the top, and the different buttons for creating layers at the bottom. You can rename any layer from this editor by doing a slow double click on the name (note that you cannot use anything except letters numbers and the underbar&nbsp;<span class="inline2">_</span> character for names) and you can also switch its visibility on or off by clicking the eye icon <img alt="Eye Icon" class="icon" height="21" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Eye.png" width="21">. If the room has inherited layers from a parent room, you can toggle the inheritance from the button at the bottom, but note that this will affect all layers (see&nbsp;<a href="Room_Inheritance.htm">Room Inheritance</a>&nbsp;for more information on inheritance).

You can also delete one or more selected layers by clicking the delete button <img alt="Delete Layer Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_DeleteLayer.png" width="24">.

You can also scale the instance along either or both the axis, and set its position within the room, as well as the image speed and initial frame for the sprite to use.</p><p class="dropspot">Finally you can give the instance some creation code which will run directly after the object creation event code, and is unique to this instance (so you can, say, set a variable in the object which all instance will have then modify it in the creation code so that it's a unique value for one instance). Clicking this will chain a <a href="../Scripts.htm">script window</a>&nbsp;to the instance where you can add any functions or modify any variables and this code will be run directly after the instance has been created and the instance <a href="../Object_Properties/Event_Order.htm">Create Event</a> has been run. Note that you can toggle inheritance of creation code on or off <em>independently</em> of the instance inheritance.</p><p class="dropspot">It is worth noting that each instance on a layer is automatically flagged for exporting when the game is made. However, especially when working with inheritance, it may be that you don't <em>want</em> specific instances to be added to the room in the final game (or you may have a debug instance in every room and simply want to exclude it from the final game). If that is the case, then simply un-checking the "<strong>Export</strong>" checkbox to the left of the instance in the list will prevent it from being exported as part of the executable. It is important to note, however, that if you have any code that references the instance, <strong>then the game will not run correctly</strong>, so use this feature with care.</p><p class="dropspot">&nbsp;</p></div><p><img alt="Tile map Layer Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Tilemap.png" style="margin-left:24px"><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down3" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Tiles</span><span data-close-text="true">Tiles</span></a></p><div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down3"><p class="dropspot">You can add a new tile layer by clicking on the <img alt="Tile map Layer Icon" class="icon" height="24" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Tilemap.png" width="24">&nbsp;button.

Sequences are "collections" of sprites, sounds and instances that will play when the room is entered.
