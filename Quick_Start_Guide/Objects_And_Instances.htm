Once you select a sprite you can also click {} on the {}Edit Sprite{} {} or {}Edit Image{} {} buttons to edit either the images of the sprite itself or the sprite asset.

This general draw event will be called, like the step event, every game frame, but it works in two different ways. The first is when you don\'t add this event to the object... When there is no {}specified {}Draw Event, then {}GameMaker{} will default to drawing the sprite assigned to the object, using any transforms that have been applied elsewhere in the object (like to change its size or alpha blending), so even when no Draw Event is listed in the Events list, it is still being run and will still draw to the screen when an instance is placed in a room. The second way it works is when you add the event itself and include any GML or GML Visual in it. Adding something to the event tells {}GameMaker{} " {}I want to control what you draw for instances of this object{}" and it completely over-rides the default draw. This means that you can have an object with a sprite assigned, then set the draw event to draw text and the sprite will not be drawn as you have not told {}GameMaker{} to draw it, although the text will be.':'在绘制事件类别中有多个不同的绘制事件，但您使用最多的是位于顶部的事件，简称为"绘制"。与步事件一样，这个常规的抽签事件将被称为每个游戏帧，但它有两种不同的工作方式。第一种情况是当您没有将此事件添加到对象时...。如果没有{}指定{}绘制事件，则 {}GameMaker{} 将默认使用对象中其他位置应用的任何变换(如更改其大小或Alpha混合)绘制指定给对象的精灵，因此即使在事件列表中没有列出绘制事件，它仍在运行，并且当实例放置在房间中时仍将绘制到屏幕上。第二种工作方式是当您添加事件本身并在其中包含任何GML或GML可视内容时。在事件中添加一些内容会告诉 {}GameMaker{} "{}我想控制您为该对象的实例绘制的内容{}"，它会完全覆盖默认绘制。这意味着您可以指定一个指定了精灵的对象，然后将绘制事件设置为绘制文本，并且不会绘制精灵，因为您没有告诉 {}GameMaker{} 绘制它，尽管文本将会绘制。',"This event happens when an instance of the object is first created, and is the very first thing that happens within an instance that has been placed in the room through the room editor when a room is entered.
