You can use this to compile executable packages for smaller games or games where performance is not ever going to be an issue.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>YYC</strong>: The YYC (<a href="../Settings/YoYo_Compiler.htm">YoYo Compiler</a>) generates C++ code from your GML code, before using the target's C++ compiler to compile&nbsp;it into native code for the target platform. It strips out unneeded functions and performs a host of other optimisation techniques to create a smaller and performance-enhanced executable package.<br><br>This can increase your game's performance by at least two or three times, especially on logic-heavy games, and is ideal for those larger or CPU-intensive projects. Compile times may take longer and you should always clear the compiler cache before building any final complete asset package for a target platform. Note that the YYC target may require extra tools to be installed for the platform selected, otherwise it will not work - you can find further information about this from the <a href="https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/227860547-GMS2-Required-SDKs">YoYo Games Help Center</a> as well as on the individual <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Platform_Preferences.htm">target Preferences</a>&nbsp;pages detailed in this manual.</li><li class="dropspot"><strong>JavaScript</strong>: The JavaScript target will only be available for specific targets, like the HTML5 target, and sets the game to be compiled to pure JavaScript.
