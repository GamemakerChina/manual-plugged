The full shader is comprised of a vertex shader program, and a fragment shader program (also known as a pixel shader). Both of these tiny programs work together in order to manipulate what the graphics card renders to the screen.

  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">The Asset Browser</span></h1>
  <p>The core of your game will be created from assets added to the <strong>Asset Browser</strong> located by default on the right of the <a class="tooltip" title="The IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. In this case, the entire frontend of GameMaker Studio 2 is considered the IDE, and includes sections to create graphics, add sounds, and add code to make your games.">IDE</a>. This is where you can add everything that your game requires to run, including a game room, <a class="tooltip" title="A sprite is a bitmap graphic that is designed to be part of a larger scene. It can either be a static image or an animated graphic.">sprites</a>, objects, paths and a number of other things. A basic game in <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> will require a room to run in (new projects will always be created with a room asset already created), and usually at least one object and a sprite, although you'll likely use a lot more!</p>
  <p><img alt="The Asset Browser Components" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser.png"></p>
  <p><span data-field="title" data-format="default">The Asset Browser</span>&nbsp;is where you'll create and organise the assets for your game as well as modify certain other aspects like platform specific settings and configurations.

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down4">
    <p class="dropspot">This section of the asset browser is used to give you various methods to quickly access important or frequently used assets, and is split into the following sections:</p>
    <ul class="dropspotlist">
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Recent</strong>: Here you can find a list of the most recently used assets. By default a maximum of 10 assets will be listed here, but you can change this from the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Asset_Browser_Preferences.htm">Asset Browser Preferences</a>.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Favourites</strong>: Once you have added some assets to the asset list, you may have some that you access frequently at any given time and so to make things easier you can flag these assets as "favourites", which will add them to this list and let you quickly find them. To flag an asset as a <em>favourite</em> use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png">&nbsp;on it and select Favourite from the pop-up menu. Note that you can use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png">&nbsp;again to <em>unfavourite </em>any asset, and if you use the button on the main Favourites folder, you can select <em>Clear All</em> to remove everything.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Room Order</strong>: From here you can change the order that your rooms will run in. All projects require at least one room to run and the room at the top of the list is the "home" room and will be the first room entered when the game initially starts (it is flagged with a "home" icon <img alt="The Home Room Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_AssetHome.png">). To quickly change room order, simply click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png">&nbsp;and drag the room up or down the list and then release the mouse button to place it at the new position. If you click the "home" icon, then you will open the <strong>Room Manager</strong> and if you use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png">&nbsp;on a room you can create a <strong>child </strong>room. For more information on room order and child rooms please see the page on <a href="../Settings/The_Room_Manager.htm">The Room Manager</a>.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Saved Filters</strong>: When using the filtering options, you may want to save the selection you've made for future reference. To do that, set up the filter as explained further up this page, and then click the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png">&nbsp;on this option and select <em>Save Filter</em>. The filter will be saved to this list and you can rename it if required. To use the filter, simply double click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png">&nbsp;on it or use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png">&nbsp;menu option <em>Apply Filter</em>. You can also <em>Delete </em>and <em>Rename </em>saved filters from the RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png">&nbsp;menu.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Tags</strong>: All assets in the Asset Browser can be assigned user-defined <strong>Tags</strong>. These will then be listed here and you can use them to filter the assets shown in the asset list and you can double-click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png">&nbsp;any tag (or use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png">&nbsp;option <em>Filter By Tag</em>) to apply that tag to the asset list filter. Any applied tags are shown at the bottom of the asset browser in the <strong>Information </strong>section. For more information on tags, see further down in this page.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Game Options</strong>: Here you can quickly access the various different <strong>Game Options</strong> for your project. These control various different aspects of the project related to setting up and compiling for the different target platforms (what Game Options are available will depend on what licence type you have). You can find more information on each of the options listed from the section on the <a href="../Settings/Game_Options.htm">Game Options</a>.</li>

    <p class="dropspot">This section of the asset browser lists all the different assets that you are using in your game. By default - when you create a new project - this will be populated with numerous folder groups labelled with the different kinds of assets that can be added, but these can be renamed or even removed and you don't have to store assets of the same kind in each group. For example, you may find it more useful to create a group of assets for each level of your game rather than for each kind of asset, so you can create folder groups called "Level 1", "Level 2", etc. and store all the different assets for each level in the same folder. How you organise things really is up to you!</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Asset Browser Example" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_CustomList.png"> To add a new asset to the list you can use the <strong>Add Asset</strong> button at the top of the Asset Browser, or you can open the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png">&nbsp;menu anywhere in the asset list and then select the asset type to create:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Create Asset RMB Menu" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_CreateAsset.png"> Once the asset has been created it will be opened in the workspace and you can rename it to something that is appropriate to your game, but note that asset names can only be alpha-numeric, cannot start with a number, and can only use the underscore "_" as an additional character. You can also use the RMB&nbsp;<img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"> menu to create new folder groups to contain assets using the <strong>Create Group</strong> option, and these can be named anything you wish. If you want to rename any asset or folder group, then you can do a slow double-click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png">&nbsp;on them or use the RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png">&nbsp;menu option <strong>Rename</strong>.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">An important feature of the Asset Browser is the ability to <a id="colour_assets"></a>colour assets so they are more immediately recognisable within the list. You can do this by clicking the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png">&nbsp;on the asset or folder to bring up the RMB menu and then selecting a colour from the colour strip at the bottom. If you do this on a group, then this will also colour any asset contained within the group:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Tags</h1>
  <p>As mentioned in various of the sections above, the asset browser gives you the ability to add tags to individual assets as well as to group folders. Tags are a very powerful tool, not only for organising and filtering the assets listed in the asset browser, but also when programming your game in general, as you can use assigned tags in code.</p>
  <p>To create a tag you need to use the RMB&nbsp;<img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png"> menu on an asset and then select the <em>Edit Tags</em>&nbsp;option. This will bring up the <strong>Tag Editor</strong> where you can type in the tag you want to use, and then either press&nbsp;<img alt="Enter" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Enter.png" title="Enter" width="55"> or type a comma&nbsp;to apply it:</p>
  <p><img alt="The Tag Editor" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_EditTags.gif">You can assign multiple tags to a single item, and you can also use <img alt="Shift Key Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png" width="55">&nbsp;or <img alt="CTRL Key Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" width="55"> / <img alt="CMD Key Icon" class="icon" height="20" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" width="55">&nbsp;along with the left mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png">&nbsp;to select multiple assets and assign a tag to all of them at once. Once added, all tags will be visible under the Quick Access menu and also in the Filter options (as explained in the sections above), and so can be used to quickly filter the asset list and show only those items with the chosen tag or tags.</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="../assets/snippets/Tag_note.hts"><span class="note">NOTE</span></span>&nbsp;Assigning a tag to a folder group will <strong>not </strong>automatically assign it to the assets inside it.</p>
  <p>It is important to note that assets that are created while tags are part of the active filter <strong>will be given those tags automatically</strong>. This means that if you are viewing all assets under the "Level 1" tag - for example - all new assets created with this filter active will also have the "Level 1" tag added to them upon creation.</p>
  <p>Finally, tags can also be used in your project code to identify any asset and then act on it, making it a very powerful tool as you can code behaviours based on a tag or group of tags. For example, imagine you have a project with a "<span class="inline">Die On Touch</span>" tag. When programming the project, you can check this tag and code functionality that is appropriate, then later the artists and level designers can create new assets of any type and tag them with the "<span class="inline">Die On Touch</span>" tag then use the asset when designing a level. Any code that has been programmed to use this tag will automatically include these new assets.</p>
  <p>For more information on using tags in the project code, please see the section on <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Assets_And_Tags/Assets_And_Tags.htm">Assets And Tags</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>RMB Menu</h1>
  <p>When working with the Asset Browser, you can use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png">&nbsp;on any asset or folder to open a menu of options:</p>
  <p><img alt="Asset Browser RMB Menu" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_RMBMenu.png">The exact options available to you will depend on the context that has been clicked, and below we show the contents when the menu is opened on an asset or folder group in the Asset List (other contexts will show some of these but not all):</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Create </strong>- Create a new asset. On selecting this you will be presented with a list of the available asset types that can be created for you to select one. Note that if you open this menu on a specific asset, there will be an additional option to create an asset of the same type listed just below so you don't have to look for the asset type in the list.</li>
    <li><strong>Edit (All) </strong>- Open the asset properties editor for the selected asset(s) or folder group (note that you can double click <img alt="Icon LMB" class="icon" height="24" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" width="21">&nbsp;on a single asset too to open it for it editing).</li>
    <li><strong>Edit Tags</strong> - This will open the Tag editor where you can add or remove tags to the selected asset(s) or folder group(s).</li>
    <li><strong>Rename </strong>- Rename the asset or the folder group.</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicate </strong>- Create a duplicate of the asset or assets that have been selected.</li>
    <li><strong>Favourite </strong>- Flag&nbsp;an asset or assets as being a favourite, adding it to the Quick Access section at the top of the Asset browser.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Existing</strong> - Add existing assets from a different <span data-keyref="GameMaker Name">GameMaker</span> project folder. Please note that assets created using a version anterior to 2.3.0 will require conversion as the project file format changed with the 2.3.0 update. This means it may be preferable to import the entire project and converting everything then saving it to a new location if the assets are imported frequently into other projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Existing From My Library</strong> - Add assets to the asset list from an item in your Marketplace library. Please note that Marketplace assets created using a version anterior to 2.3.0 will require conversion as the project file format changed with the 2.3.0 update.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete </strong>- Delete the selected asset(s) from the project. This cannot be undone!</li>
    <li><strong>Create Group</strong> - Add a new folder group to the asset list.</li>
    <li><strong>Expand Children</strong> - Expand the currently selected folder group along with any sub-folders it may contain.</li>
    <li><strong>Expand All</strong> - Expand all the folder groups in the asset list.</li>
    <li><strong>Contract All</strong> - Contract all the folder groups in the asset list.</li>
    <li><strong>Open In New Asset Browser</strong> - This option is only available for folder groups, and it will open the group in a new Asset browser window containing only the contents of the parent group the option was selected for.</li>
    <li><strong>Open in Explorer</strong> - This will open the file explorer on the location of the file that has been stored for the asset in your project folder.</li>
    <li><strong>Colour Swatches</strong> - Here you can select a new colour for the asset to use. If used on a folder group, all assets within the folder will get the chosen colour, and if used on one or more assets, this will override any colour set in for the folder group (unless you have overridden this option in the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Asset_Browser_Preferences.htm">Asset Browser Preferences</a>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Asset Types</h1>
  <p>Now you know how the Asset Browser works, you should get to know the different types of asset that you can add to it. Below we give an overview of each of the different asset types available for you to use in your projects:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 48px"><img alt="Animation Curve Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Curves.png">&nbsp;<a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down17" href="#"><span data-open-text="true" data-skip-index="true">Animation Curves</span><span data-close-text="true">Animation Curves</span></a></p>

    <p class="dropspot">An animation curve is a resource that contains one or more curves that represent how a value changes over time, and can use <a class="tooltip" title="Linear interpolation involves estimating a new value by connecting two adjacent known values with a straight line. You can then get the interpolated value by checking any point along the line. In graphics, linear interpolation refers to a basic method of smoothing pixel edges.">linear interpolation</a> or <a class="tooltip" title="This is a type of non-linear interpolation based on mathematical splines. It is used to estimate a new value by connecting two adjacent known values using 'smooth' curves (splines), and a new value can be derived from any point along the line.">catmull-rom interpolation</a> to go between values in the curve. The values you set can be between -1 and 1 on the vertical axis and the duration along the horizontal axis is always normalised form 0 to 1, making it easy to target different time ranges using multipliers in your game code. Animation curves are comprised of "channels" and each channel can have its own curve settings, which permits you to - for example - describe a spacial position with two channels for the x/y position, or a colour gradient with 4 channels to represent a colour format. Animation curve assets can be used when working with sequences and can also be accessed using code, making them a powerful tool when creating your games.</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down14">
    <p class="dropspot">Objects are a special resource that we use to control aspects of a game and to do specific things. Most of the time they have <a class="tooltip" title="A sprite is a bitmap graphic that is designed to be part of a larger scene. It can either be a static image or an animated graphic.">sprites</a>&nbsp;associated with them so that you see them in the game room, but sometimes they are used as a "behind the scenes" controller to do things related to the user or for timing, etc. They can be given behaviours and they can react to certain events as well as to each other, and most of the things you see in a game are based on objects and their interactions. Note that we say "based on" because you don't actually place objects directly into the game room, but rather you place <strong>instances </strong>of these objects, which are basically copies (or clones if you prefer) of the object resource. This is a very important thing to remember as instances and objects are not the same thing and each have their own set of functions that can affect them.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">All objects have a set of properties which you can specify in the object editor, like the sprite, whether it uses <a class="tooltip" title="In GameMaker, when we talk about an object, instance or room using 'physics' we mean it is using the built-in physics simulation functions, based on the Box2D physics library.">physics</a> or not, or whether it is a "child" object of another one. They also have a series of built-in variables that can then be used in actions, scripts and code. These built-in variables are used to define the position of the instance when placed in the game room, the animation speed, the direction of movement and a whole host of other things. To control how the object behaves over time, each game frame is split into a series of events, so you can add code or actions into a specific event and it will only run when the event is triggered, and events can be triggered by things like mouse button presses or collisions with other instances.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Objects are in a very real sense the building blocks of your game, and together with rooms will form the core of any project that you create.</p>

    <p class="dropspot">At some point while creating your games you may need an instance of one of your objects to follow a path through a level. Now, this can be done by simply creating an array of positions within the room and then having the instance move between them, but that can be a chore to set up and is difficult to change, test and adapt for different things. That is when you'd want to create a path resource.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">The basic idea of the path resource is rather simple - you define a path by drawing it in the path editor, then you can place an action (or code) in an event of an object to tell the object to follow that particular path in the game room. You can set the speed to follow the path and a number of other actions relating to the position and orientation of the path within the room too.</p>

However the Room Editor is one of the most powerful of resources available to you, since it permits you to not only add instances of objects, but to set up the "view" into the game room, add the backgrounds and tiles that are drawn to create the game world, create extra special effects that are independent of the object/instance system, and as well as run code independently of an object. Rooms can also be set to <strong>inherit </strong>properties from other rooms, meaning that you can create a single room with a load of tiles, for example, and then make another room that inherits these tiles, so that you don't have to re-create them again.</p>

For example, say you want to have all your enemy objects create a number of different instances when they die - like some gold, an explosion and some blood as well as play a sound. Now you could add all the required code into each object that requires it, but in general you'd be better off creating a single function in script resource and then calling that. This means that you only have to add one line of code into the objects to call this new scripted function, and if you wish to change something you only need to change it once in the script and all the objects will automatically run the new code, rather than have to go through every object and change the same thing in multiple places.</p>

    <p class="dropspot">Shaders are a very powerful tool that can be used to manipulate the graphics that your game renders to the screen, permitting incredibly fast effects that can range from, for example, adding a subtle colour hue to a sprite, right up to full screen distortion effects. Basically it's a two-part program that runs directly on the graphics card itself, making it very fast since the GPU is doing all the work and freeing up CPU cycles for your game code. The full shader is comprised of a vertex shader program, and a fragment shader program (also known as a pixel shader). Both of these tiny programs work together in order to manipulate what the graphics card renders to the screen. This then permits you to manipulate in realtime the position, colour, and alpha values that are actually rendered into the display buffer.</p>

Once you create a time line you can then assign it to an object, and the instance of that object will then execute the actions and code at the indicated moments of time when placed or created within a room.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">You can find out more about adding timelines from the section on <a href="../The_Asset_Editors/Timelines.htm">The Timeline Editor</a>.</p>

    <p class="dropspot">Particle systems allow for graphical effects using particles. A particle <em>system</em> consists of one or more particle <em>emitters</em>&nbsp;that create particles of a certain <em>type</em> in a given region of the particle system. The end result is several particles that move around in all kinds of directions, with variations in colour, alpha and many other configurable properties.</p>
