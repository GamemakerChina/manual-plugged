When in predictive text mode, the virtual keyboard will not generate normal ","GameMaker"," key-press events. Instead, it will only update the ","last"," character pressed and keyboard string variables. This is due to the inability to detect whether a change in the internal text field used for detecting key presses came from an actual virtual keyboard key, or a text suggestion.
