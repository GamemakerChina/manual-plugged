Note that this command is the same as pressing the Run button "," in the IDE."," ","Debug ","- Run your current project for testing with the debugger so that you can see detailed performance information and debug any errors or issues you may have.

However sometimes a \"stale\" cache can lead to odd and unexpected errors in your game, in which case the first thing you should do is clean the cache from here and re-test. It is also a good idea to clean the cache before you create a final executable for the target platform. Note that this command is the same as pressing the ","Clean Cache"," button "," in the IDE."," ","Create Executable"," - This will compile the current project and create an ","executable package"," (or packages) for the target platform. It will first open the file explorer so that you can select where you want to save the project and then compile the game. See the section on ","Compiling"," for more information on setting up the compile targets. This command is the same as pressing the ","Create Executable"," button "," in the IDE."," ","Create Executable and Launch"," - This will create an executable, just like the option above, and then it will launch that executable on the target platform.
