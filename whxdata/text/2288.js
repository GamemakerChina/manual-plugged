It is intended primarily as a tool for making 2D games - although 3D games are perfectly doable - and comes with a number of tools and editors to help you realize your dreams and ideas, with your final project being ported across multiple platforms from the same initial base resources. "," ","For those that are new to the world of programming or who have never used any game creation tool before, ","GameMaker"," offers an intuitive and easy to use ","GML Visual"," interface of actions that allow you to start creating your own games very quickly using visual scripting:"," ","If you are a more experienced - or less visual - programmer, then you can use the ","proprietary"," scripting language ","GML ","to create your games:"," ","You can even combine both and mix GML functions with GML Visual actions, giving you a great deal of flexibility when it comes to how you write things.
