A compiler error happens when your game encounters some type of error that the syntax checker may not have been able to detect - it's very easy to forget to declare a variable or mistakenly type a string as a real, for example - or when an error is related to how you have set up the compile tools from the ","Platform Preferences"," for the target platform. These errors will be caught by ","GameMaker"," as the game is being compiled and this information will also be shown in the ","Compiler Error Output",", as shown below:"," ","NOTE"," These errors don't usually pop up a window and will simply show \"","Build Failed","\" in the compiler output.
