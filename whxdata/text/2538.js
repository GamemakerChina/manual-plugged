Fonts added in this way are assigned to their own texture page, so care should be taken when using this function as it will increment the number of texture swaps when drawing. It is also worth noting that fonts may appear slightly larger when drawn, since glyphs may have parts that are drawn outside of the bounding box defined for the font. You should be aware too that there is a limitation of around 200 glyphs that can be rendered in a single frame for a particular font."," ","By default, added fonts will have anti-aliasing enabled.
