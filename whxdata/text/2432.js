As such, this is the most general of all functions for drawing text and gives a large amount of flexibility when drawing. Note that the \"width\"\n    argument is based on a scale of 1, so if the scale is different, this value should be changed proportionally. For example, if the base width for a line break is 300 and you set the scale to 2, then the text will appear wrong, over-running the given\n    width. Instead you should have set the width to 150 to compensate the scaling."," ","NOTE",": Gradient blending is not available for the HTML5 target unless WebGL is enabled, although you can still set the blending colours and it will blend the font with the first given colour. However all blending in this way creates a duplicate\n    font which is then stored in the cache and used when required, which is far from optimal and if you use multiple colour changes it will slow down your games performance.
