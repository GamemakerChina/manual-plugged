To end and draw the primitive you must call ","draw_primitive_end()","."," ","You can also choose to draw only ","part"," of the texture over the surface of the primitive by setting the appropriate xtex/ytex position to sample to (these coordinates are also known as the ","UV"," points). This point is defined by a value between 0 and 1 with the top left corner of the image to use being the (0,0) point and the bottom right corner being the (1,1) point.
