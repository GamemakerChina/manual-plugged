Surfaces are always held in texture memory which means that they can be destroyed from one moment to the next (for example, when a screensaver starts on windows, or when minimised on an Android device), so you should always check that a surface exists before doing anything with it (this includes drawing it to the screen). The example code below shows a typical use of this command in the draw event of an instance to check for a surface and re-create it if it has been removed (note that the surface will have been originally created in the create event of the object)."],[" ","surface_exists(surface_id);"," ","Argument","Type"," ","Description"," ","surface_id","Surface ID"," ","The ID of the surface to check."],[" ","Boolean"],[" ","if !surface_exists(surf)","\n    {","\n        surf = surface_create(1024, 1024);","\n    }","\n    else","\n    {","\n        if view_current = 1","\n        {","\n            draw_surface(surf,0,0);","\n        }","\n    }"," ","The above code will check to see if a surface indexed in the variable \"surf\" exists, and if it does not, it will re-create it.
