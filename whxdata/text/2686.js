All these functions are affected by the position of the ","listener"," within the audio environment and so will require that you use the provided functions for changing the listener position, velocity and orientation too (see - ","Audio Listeners",")."],[" ","By combining audio emitters and listeners you can create a rich, lively environment.

The falloff model determines how the volume of the sound being played changes with the distance from the listener to the emitter."," ","It is not strictly required that you set this but if you don't call this function the model used will be the default ","audio_fa","lloff_none",". This means that the gain is set to 1 and so the volume of a sound does not change with the distance from the listener to the emitter."," ","NOTE"," If you want to make sure sounds can no longer be heard past the maximum distance you should set one of the falloff models that end in ","_scaled","."],[" ","The default audio listener is located at position ","(0, 0, 0)",". ","audio_play_sound"," plays a sound at the listener's position. So by default sounds that are played this way will be audible through both speakers, right and left."," ","From the moment the relative position of the listener to the sound or emitter changes (by either changing the listener or the emitter position) this will no longer be the case."," ","It does not only have a ","position",", it also has an ","orientation",", which can be changed using ","audio_listener_orientation",". By default, however, that orientation is upside down! The default orientation has the up vector set to ","(0, 1, 0)",", but since ","GameMaker","'s y axis points downward, that means the listener is standing upside down in the room."," ","Everything that you expect to hear in the left speaker will actually be heard in the right speaker and vice versa (see the page on ","audio_listener_orientation"," for an image of how this looks). So once you start moving emitters and the listener around, make sure to set the listener's orientation to the following: "," ","audio_listener_orientation(0, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0);"," ","The above line of code will set the default listener's orientation so that it looks ","into the screen"," and ","faces up",". So this corresponds to a listener standing or sitting at the computer looking at the screen."," ","When you are creating a top-down game it can be more interesting to make the listener's orientation follow the direction that the player (or any other \"listener\") is facing. That can be done by the following line of code: "," ","audio_listener_orientation(0, 0, 1, lengthdir_x(1, direction), lengthdir_y(1, direction), 0);"," ","In this line of code, instead of having an up vector that doesn't change at all (y = -1 all the time), you change it based on the direction of the player.
