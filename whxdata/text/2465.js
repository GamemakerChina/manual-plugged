The image below shows how a gear would typically be created in a game:"," ","So what happens? Well, once the two joints are added into the gear, interaction with one will have an effect on the other, so in the example image above, if you rotate inst2, inst3 will move up and down, or if you move inst3 up and down then inst2 will rotate. You can also change the gear ratio, meaning that you need to move one instance more (or less) to get the desired effect. The code in the example at the bottom shows how something like the image above can be created."," ","NOTE"," If you need to delete either of the two instances that are involved in the gear joint (or just delete their joints) then you ","must"," delete the gear joint first using ","physics_joint_delete()"," or else you will get an error!"],[" ","physics_joint_gear_create","(inst1, inst2, joint_1, joint_2, ratio)"," ","Argument"," ","Type"," ","Description"," ","inst1"," ","Object Instance"," ","The first instance to connect with the joint"," ","inst2"," ","Object Instance"," ","The second instance to connect with the joint"," ","joint_1"," ","Real"," ","A previously defined revolute joint"," ","joint_2"," ","Real"," ","A previously defined revolute ","or"," prismatic joint"," ","ratio"," ","Real"," ","Set the velocity ratio between the two joints"],[" ","Physics Joint ID"],[" ","var t_fix, g_fix, inst1, inst2, inst3, r_joint, p_joint;","\n    g_fix = physics_fixture_create();","\n    physics_fixture_set_box_shape(g_fix, 40, 10);","\n    t_fix = physics_fixture_create();","\n    physics_fixture_set_circle_shape(t_fix, 10);","\n    physics_fixture_set_density(t_fix, 0.5);","\n    inst1 = instance_create_layer(60, room_height - 30, \"Background\", obj_Ground);","\n    inst2 = instance_create_layer(40, room_height - 300, \"Instances\", obj_Cog);","\n    inst3 = instance_create_layer(150, room_height - 300, \"Instances\", obj_Barrel);","\n    physics_fixture_bind(g_fix, inst1);","\n    physics_fixture_bind(t_fix, inst2);","\n    physics_fixture_bind(t_fix, inst3);","\n    r_joint = physics_joint_revolute_create(inst1, inst2, 40, room_height - 300, -80, 80, 1, 10, 0.5, 1, 0);","\n    p_joint = physics_joint_prismatic_create(inst1, inst3, 150, room_height - 300, 0, 1, -10, 10, true, 0, 0, 0, 0);"," ","physics_joint_gear_create","(inst2, inst3, r_joint, p_joint, 0.5);\n  "," ","The above code creates and defines two fixture and then creates three instances, one \"obj_Ground\" and two others, \"obj_Cog\" and \"obj_Barrel\".
