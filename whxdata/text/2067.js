When the room is changed, and if the following room does ","not"," have a layer with the same name or depth as the one assigned, then a new layer will be created for the instance that is persisting across the rooms. If you gave a named layer when the instance was created, then the new layer will also be named the same as original layer, while if you assigned a depth to the instance then the new layer will be named \"","_layer_XXX","\", where \"XXX\" is a hex value used to give the layer a unique name. These layers will be removed from the room on Room End. Another thing to note about layers and persistent instances is that if you have assigned the instance a named layer on creation, and there is another layer in the following rooms with the same name, then the persisted instance will be assigned to the layer with the same name ","regardless of the depth of the layer",".
