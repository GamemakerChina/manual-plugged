","GameMaker"," has a number of built in functions to help you deal with collisions correctly and in accordance with the needs of your project."," ","NOTE"," Collision functions used to use integer values in previous versions of GameMaker, however they now use floating point values meaning that collision functions will no longer round non-integer arguments.

These collision functions all work slightly differently but they maintain three common arguments which we will explain here:"," ","obj",": This is where we specify the object that the function has to check for a collision with. It can be an instance id, an object type, or the special GM keyword ","all",". It is also worth noting that if the object type chosen is the designated ","parent"," of other objects, then all ","children"," of that object will be included in this check too."," ","prec",": This can be either ","true"," or ","false"," and relates to the precision of the collision checking. If set to ","true",", then precise collisions are to be calculated (but only if the object being checked for has \"precise\" marked for its collision detection in its mask properties) which is a slightly more complex task for the CPU and so should be used with caution. If ","false"," then collisions will be calculated based on the bounding box of the object to be checked for."," ","notme",": You may need to check for collisions with an object that has the same index as the object that runs the code, so to prevent the code finding a collision with itself, you can set this to ","true",". If you are specifically looking for the instance of the object running the code, or it's not important, it can be left as ","false","."," ","The basic functions will return either the ID of an instance found to be colliding, or the special keyword ","noone"," when there is no collision, while the ","list"," functions will return the number of instances that are in collision and populate a pre-made DS list with their IDs. Note that if there are multiple collisions with the areas defined by these functions and instances of the given object, only ","one"," instance ID is returned, and it can be ","any one of the instances in the collision","."," ","The following functions exist that deal with advanced collisions."," ","collision_circle"," ","collision_circle_list"," ","collision_ellipse"," ","collision_ellipse_list"," ","collision_line"," ","collision_line_list"," ","collision_point"," ","collision_point_list"," ","collision_rectangle"," ","collision_rectangle_list"],[" ","All of the above functions are related to collision checking ","instances",", and as such rely on the collision mask that is defined for the instance.
