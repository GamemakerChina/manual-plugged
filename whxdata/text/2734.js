By default - when you create a new project - this will be populated with numerous folder groups labelled with the different kinds of assets that can be added, but these can be renamed or even removed and you don't have to store assets of the same kind in each group. For example, you may find it more useful to create a group of assets for each level of your game rather than for each kind of asset, so you can create folder groups called \"Level 1\", \"Level 2\", etc. and store all the different assets for each level in the same folder.

Note that there are a couple of preferences available to deal with how this works in the ","Asset Browser Preferences","."],[" ","As mentioned in various of the sections above, the asset browser gives you the ability to add tags to individual assets as well as to group folders. Tags are a very powerful tool, not only for organising and filtering the assets listed in the asset browser, but also when programming your game in general, as you can use assigned tags in code."," ","To create a tag you need to use the RMB "," menu on an asset and then select the ","Edit Tags"," option. This will bring up the ","Tag Editor"," where you can type in the tag you want to use, and then either press "," or type a comma to apply it:"," ","You can assign multiple tags to a single item, and you can also use "," or "," / "," along with the left mouse button "," to select multiple assets and assign a tag to all of them at once. Once added, all tags will be visible under the Quick Access menu and also in the Filter options (as explained in the sections above), and so can be used to quickly filter the asset list and show only those items with the chosen tag or tags."," ","NOTE"," Assigning a tag to a folder group will ","not ","automatically assign it to the assets inside it."," ","It is important to note that assets that are created while tags are part of the active filter ","will be given those tags automatically",". This means that if you are viewing all assets under the \"Level 1\" tag - for example - all new assets created with this filter active will also have the \"Level 1\" tag added to them upon creation."," ","Finally, tags can also be used in your project code to identify any asset and then act on it, making it a very powerful tool as you can code behaviours based on a tag or group of tags. For example, imagine you have a project with a \"","Die On Touch","\" tag. When programming the project, you can check this tag and code functionality that is appropriate, then later the artists and level designers can create new assets of any type and tag them with the \"","Die On Touch","\" tag then use the asset when designing a level. Any code that has been programmed to use this tag will automatically include these new assets."," ","For more information on using tags in the project code, please see the section on ","Assets And Tags","."],[" ","When working with the Asset Browser, you can use the right mouse button "," on any resource or folder to open a menu of options:"," ","The exact options available to you will depend on the context that has been clicked, and below we show the contents when the menu is opened on an asset or folder group in the Asset List (other contexts will show some of these but not all):"," ","Create ","- Create a new asset.

The values you set can be between -1 and 1 on the vertical axis and the duration along the horizontal axis is always normalised form 0 to 1, making it easy to target different time ranges using multipliers in your game code. Animation curves are comprised of \"channels\" and each channel can have its own curve settings, which permits you to - for example - describe a spacial position with two channels for the x/y position, or a colour gradient with 4 channels to represent a colour format. Animation curve assets can be used when working with sequences and can also be accessed using code, making them a powerful tool when creating your games."," ","You can find out more about adding animation curves from the section on ","Animation Curves","."," "," ","Extensions"," "," ","Extensions are additional files and code that you can add to extend the ","GameMaker"," functionality as well as add assets to your game from the ","Marketplace",".

This is where the ","Font Editor"," is used. Here you can select a font that you have on your computer and import it into ","GameMaker"," for use in your game, setting various attributes like size and weight or style. Once imported and added as a resource, you can then set it for drawing using the appropriate code or actions."," ","NOTE",": If you are adding fonts to your game, make sure you have the licence necessary to re-distribute it, unless it is public domain or copyright free."," ","The RMB "," menu for fonts contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):"," ","Assign Texture Group"," - When you select this option, you will be presented with a list of the available texture groups, and you can then choose one to add the font to or create a new one, if required.

Most of the time they have ","sprites"," associated with them so that you see them in the game room, but sometimes they are used as a \"behind the scenes\" controller to do things related to the user or for timing, etc... They can be given behaviours and they can react to certain events as well as to each other, and most of the things you see in a game are based on objects and their interactions. Note that we say \"based on\" because you don't actually place objects directly into the game room, but rather you place ","instances ","of these objects, which are basically copies (or clones if you prefer) of the object resource. This is a very important thing to remember as instances and objects are not the same thing and each have their own set of functions that can affect them."," ","All objects have a set of properties which you can specify in the object editor, like the sprite, whether it uses ","physics"," or not, or whether it is a \"child\" object of another one. They also have a series of built-in variables that can then be used in actions, scripts and code. These built-in variables are used to define the position of the instance when placed in the game room, the animation speed, the direction of movement and a whole host of other things. To control how the object behaves over time, each game frame is split into a series of events, so you can add code or actions into a specific event and it will only run when the event is triggered, and events can be triggered by things like mouse button presses or collisions with other instances."," ","Objects are in a very real sense the building blocks of your game, and together with rooms will form the core of any project that you create."," ","The RMB "," menu for objects contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):"," ","Open All Event Scripts"," - Selecting this option will open all the assigned events for the object in a new workspace as script tabs."," ","You can find out more about adding objects from the section on the ","Object Editor","."," "," ","Paths"," "," ","At some point while creating your games you may need an instance of one of your objects to follow a path through a level. Now, this can be done by simply creating an array of positions within the room and then having the instance move between them, but that can be a chore to set up and is difficult to change, test and adapt for different things. That is when you'd want to create a path resource."," ","The basic idea of the path resource is rather simple - you define a path by drawing it in the path editor, then you can place an action (or code) in an event of an object to tell the object to follow that particular path in the game room. You can set the speed to follow the path and a number of other actions relating to the position and orientation of the path within the room too."," ","You can find out more about adding paths from the section on the ","Path Editor","."," "," ","Rooms"," "," ","All games that you make in ","GameMaker"," need at least one room to run (but can have many, many more) , and a room is basically a space where you place instances of the objects that make up your game and where the action of the game will take place. However the Room Editor is one of the most powerful of resources available to you, since it permits you to not only add instances of objects, but to set up the \"view\" into the game room, add the backgrounds and tiles that are drawn to create the game world, create extra special effects that are independent of the object/instance system, and as well as run code independently of an object. Rooms can also be set to ","inherit ","properties from other rooms, meaning that you can create a single room with a load of tiles, for example, and then make another room that inherits these tiles, so that you don't have to re-create them again."," ","The RMB "," menu for rooms contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):"," ","Create Child Room"," - This will create a new room as a child of the room selected. Child rooms are new room assets that inherit the properties, layers and layer contents from the parent room, and will be shown linked to the parent room in the ","Room Manager","."," ","You can find out more about adding rooms from the section on the ","Room Editor","."," "," ","Scripts"," "," ","A script resource is simply a container for one or more functions you have written. For example, say you want to have all your enemy objects create a number of different instances when they die - like some gold, an explosion and some blood as well as play a sound. Now you could add all the required code into each object that requires it, but in general you'd be better off creating a single function in script resource and then calling that. This means that you only have to add one line of code into the objects to call this new scripted function, and if you wish to change something you only need to change it once in the script and all the objects will automatically run the new code, rather than have to go through every object and change the same thing in multiple places."," ","The RMB "," menu for scripts contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):"," ","Convert to GML Visual / GML"," - This will convert the selected script to GML Visual or GML. If the script is GML, then it will be placed within an ","Execute Code"," action, while GML Visual will be translated directly into GML code (as shown in the section ","Changing GML Visual To Code",")."," ","You can find out more about adding scripts from the section on the ","Script Editor","."," "," ","Sequences"," "," ","A sequence asset is essentially a collection of other resources that perform a dynamic animation over time. They can contain sprites, instances, sounds and other things, and each of these can be set to move or change colour, or start/stop over time within the sequence itself by assigning the assets to specific ","tracks ","within the sequence. These tracks can then have different attributes applied to them which can be static or change over time. All editing of a sequence takes place in the ","Sequence Editor"," which is comprised of:"," ","the ","Canvas ","- where you place the assets that make up the sequence "," ","the ","Track Panel"," - where you place assets to create asset tracks, as well as create parameter tracks to manipulate the assets over time"," ","Dope Sheet"," - which is where you add/remove/edit the keyframes of each track and control how they behave over time."," ","Note that you can have sequences within sequences to create complex animations and effect, and sequences can also be accessed and changed through code to give you as much control as possible over how they will be displayed and used in your game."," ","You can find out more about adding sequences from the section on the "," ","Sequences Editor","."," "," ","Shaders"," "," ","Shaders are a very powerful tool that can be used to manipulate the graphics that your game renders to the screen, permitting incredibly fast effects that can range from, for example, adding a subtle colour hue to a sprite, right up to full screen distortion effects. Basically it's a two-part program that runs directly on the graphics card itself, making it very fast since the GPU is doing all the work and freeing up CPU cycles for your game code. The full shader is comprised of a vertex shader program, and a fragment shader program (also known as a pixel shader). Both of these tiny programs work together in order to manipulate what the graphics card renders to the screen. This then permits you to manipulate in real time the position, colour, and alpha values that are actually rendered into the display buffer."," ","GameMaker"," supports the following shader languages:"," ","Shader Language"," ","Target Platform"," ","GLSL ES "," ","All target platforms"," ","GLSL"," ","Mac and Ubuntu (Linux)"," ","HLSL11"," ","Windows, XboxOne"," ","PSSL"," ","Playstation 4"," ","\n      The RMB "," menu for shaders contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):"," ","Shader Type"," - Here you can set the type of shader language that is being used for the shader resource."," ","You can find out more about adding shaders from the section on the ","Shader Editor","."," "," ","Sounds"," "," ","Sound is an important part of any game, both for adding depth to the gameplay and giving feedback in the form of sound effects, and for adding atmosphere in the form of music. ","GameMaker"," accepts ","WAV",", ","MP3 ","and ","OGG"," format files."," ","In general, ","WAV"," files are used for any short sound effects as even though they are generally larger files they will play instantaneously due to the fact that they do not need any type of decoding for playing. ","MP3"," and ","OGG"," files should be used for background music or any effect that plays over a longer period of time or that has a rather large file size. These files are much smaller than a WAV file and but do have a ","CPU overhead"," associated with them as they have to be decoded before being played."," ","The RMB  "," menu for sounds contains the following options (as well as those listed further up this page):"," ","Open In Sound Mixer"," - This will open all the selected sounds in the ","Sound Mixer","."," ","Assign Audio Group"," - When you select this option, you will be presented with a list of the available audio groups, and you can then choose one to add the sound to or create a new one, if required.
