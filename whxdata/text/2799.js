Note that this only applies to scripts that are completely empty, so even if your script only contains comments, it will still be included in the compiled game."],[" ","This leads us to the final and most important thing to know about scripts and the functions they contain: scripts are parsed on a ","global"," level and will be ","compiled at the very start of the game",". This means that ","technically"," all functions in a script are \"unbound\" ","method variables",", and any variables declared outside of a function in the script will be considered ","global variables",". For example, consider this script:"," ","function Foo()","\n    {","\n        // Do something","\n    }","\n    blah = 10;","\n    function Bar()","\n    {","\n        // Do something else","\n    }"," ","In the above case, not only have we defined the functions ","Foo"," and ","Bar"," but also the variable ","blah"," and all of them are considered to have been created in the ","global"," scope. The functions don't need the ","global"," keyword to be recognized as the compiler understands that these functions are part of the script, but if you wanted to access ","blah"," then you would need to do:"," ","val = global.blah;"," ","That said, we recommend that you ","always explicitly type global variables"," when creating them in scripts to prevent any issues later. Scripts are also an ideal place to define any ","Macros"," or ","Enums"," (","constants","), as adding them to a script outside of a function also means that they will be created for use before the game code actually starts running. Below is an example of a script that is creating different global scope values for a game:"," ","/// Initialise All Global Scope Values And Constants","\n    global.player_score = 0;","\n    global.player_hp = 100;","\n    global.pause = false;","\n    global.music = true;","\n    global.sound = true;"," ","\n    enum rainbowcolors","\n    {","\n        red,","\n        orange,","\n        yellow,","\n        green,","\n        blue,","\n        indigo,","\n        violet","\n    }"," ","\n    #macro weapon_num 3","\n    #macro weapon_gun 0","\n    #macro weapon_bomb 1","\n    #macro weapon_knife 2\n  "," ","Note how all these constants are set up outside of any function call, meaning they will be initialised before everything else and at a ","global ","scope. This means that if you want to use a script to initialise variables on an ","instance ","scope then you must wrap them in a function, for example:"," ","/// @function                init_enemy();","\n    /// @description             Initialise enemy instance vars"," ","\n    function init_enemy()","\n    {","\n        hp = 100;","\n        dmg = 5;","\n        mana = 50;","\n    }\n  "," ","So, scripts can be used to generate macros, enums and global variables before the game starts so they are ready for use at any time, and they can also be used to create \"unbound\" methods (user-defined functions) that can be used in your game like GML runtime functions."," ","One final thing to note about script functions is that if you are developing for ","Web ","(ie: targeting ","HTML5","), then there is an additional function protocol that you can use when adding functions to scripts, which is to prefix a function name with ","gmcallback_",", for example:"," ","gmcallback_create_button"," ","Using the above function name would mean that the function ","gmcallback_create_button()"," will not be obfuscated and so can be used in JavaScript extensions and other areas of your game, for example, when using the ","clickable_*"," functions."],[" ","Functions can also make use of static variables, which maintain their values throughout every function call.
