Adding torque is a gradual process, much like using a force to add movement."," ","Angular Impulse",": An angular impulse can be used to set a fixture spinning instantly, much like a regular impulse can be used to set a fixture instantly in movement."," ","The following functions exist to apply different types of forces to physics enabled instances, and each function gives a fuller explanation of how the force will be applied than the outlines given above:"," ","physics_apply_force"," ","physics_apply_impulse"," ","physics_apply_local_force"," ","physics_apply_local_impulse"," ","physics_apply_torque"," ","physics_apply_angular_impulse"," ","Back: ","Physics"," ","Next: ","Fixtures"]],"6":[[" ","Â© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2024 All Rights Reserved"]],"id":"1331"})
