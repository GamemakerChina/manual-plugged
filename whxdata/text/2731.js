You might think that you'd need to use the ","keyword"," ","other"," in this case to get the instance variable, but this is not necessary. Essentially, when you define a struct",", all member variables on the left-hand side of the colon \":\" are the ","struct"," variables, and the values and variables on the right-hand side use the scope of whatever is defining the struct"," (in this case, an instance)."," ","Let's look at a simple example to illustrate this. Say you want to define a struct with the variables \"x\" and \"y\" and you want to set them to the \"x\" and \"y\" of the instance defining the struct. In practice the code would look like this:"," ","mystruct =","\n    {","\n        x : x,","\n        y : y","\n    };"," ","In the above code the struct member variables ","x"," and ","y"," are being set to the values held in the instance variables ","x"," and ","y",", since the right-hand side of the colon \":\" refers to the instance that is defining the struct. It is worth noting that this means you ","cannot"," use struct member variables for defining subsequent variables within the struct declaration. For example, the following would give you an error:"," ","mystruct =","\n    {","\n        a : 10,","\n        b : 10,","\n        c : a + b","\n    }"," ","The error occurs because the variables ","a"," and ","b"," are actually being evaluated at the scope of whatever is defining the struct (they are on the right-hand side of the colon \":\"), and are ","not"," the ones being defined within the struct itself."," ","IMPORTANT"," You cannot use any built-in ","global variables"," as struct member names, eg: ","game_id"," or ","fps",". You can find a full list of these global variables on ","Struct Forbidden Variables","."],[" ","Once a struct has been defined, you can access the data within it using the \"point\" notation, like this:"," ","mystruct =","\n    {","\n        a : 20,","\n        b : \"Hello World\"","\n    }"," ","\n    mystring = mystruct.b + string(mystruct.a);\n  "," ","You can also perform operations on the variables within a struct or use them in functions, just as you would with any other variable. For example:"," ","mystruct.a += 1;","\n    mystruct.b = mystruct.a + 20;","\n    mydir = point_direction(mouse_x, mouse_y, mystruct.xx, mystruct.yy);"," ","Finally, structs can have other structs nested inside them, like this:"," ","mystruct =","\n    {","\n        a :","\n        {","\n            aa : \"This is an example\"","\n        },","\n        b :","\n        {","\n            bb : \"And another one\"","\n        },","\n    };"," ","To access such nested structs you would still use the point notation, like this:"," ","var _str = mystruct.a.aa + \" \" + mystruct.b.bb;","\n    show_debug_message(_str);"," ","Another way to access data in a struct is by using the ","with"," statement. So, for example, you could do this:"," ","with (mystruct)","\n    {","\n        a += other.x;","\n    }"," ","Using ","with"," changes the scope of the code to the given struct where you can manipulate the member variables at the struct scope. Note that in the example we also use the ","other"," keyword",". This works just like in an instance when using ","with"," and will reference the instance (or struct) that is actually running the code block."," ","A last way to access data in a struct is by using the struct accessor ","$",". This allows access to struct variables using strings, for both reading: "," ","var _value = mystruct[$ \"x\"];"," ","and writing: "," ","mystruct[$ \"x\"] = 200;"," ","If you need to use strings to access a struct variable, it is faster to ","get its hash"," and use that in ","read","/","write"," to the variable."," ","When a struct is no longer required it can be removed from memory using the ","delete"," operator, which flags the struct as being able to be garbage collected. This is not strictly required as the ","garbage collector"," may do this automatically if the struct is no longer referenced in your code, but it is good practice to do so and we recommend it (for example, call ","delete"," in the ","Clean Up event"," of an instance to explicitly tell the garbage collector that an instance scope struct is to be deleted). Here is an example:"," ","// Create event","\n    mystruct =","\n    {","\n        pos_x : x,","\n        pos_y : y,","\n        count : 1000","\n    };"," ","\n    // Clean Up event","\n    delete mystruct;\n  "],[" ","You can also use ","script functions"," or ","methods"," to create functions that can be used to generate new structs, which requires the use of the ","constructor"," keyword for the function and the ","new"," operator when creating a struct from such a function.

The child constructor (","Vector3",") passes the ","_x"," and ","_y"," arguments into the parent (","Vector2",") constructor, which are used to run the parent's constructor first, after which the child's constructor is executed. This way the child constructor gets the parent's variables (","x"," and ","y",") and can also define its own (","z",")."," ","You can also pass values into the parent constructor, so that a certain child constructor always provides the same values to its parent constructor:"," ","function item(damage) constructor","\n    {","\n        my_damage = damage;","\n    }"," ","\n    function basic_sword() : item(10) constructor {}"," ","\n    var _basic_sword = new basic_sword();","\n    show_debug_message(_basic_sword.my_damage); // Prints 10\n  "," ","This means that the damage of a basic sword will always be ","10",", since it passes that value to its parent constructor irrespective of what its own arguments might be."," ","Note that assigning a default value to an argument in a child constructor will override the parent's default value for that argument. See the following example:"," ","function parent(value = 10) constructor","\n    {","\n        show_debug_message(value);","\n    }"," ","\n    function child(value = 20) : parent(value) constructor","\n    {","\n        show_debug_message(value);","\n    }"," ","\n    var _child = new child();\n  "," ","Both of these constructors will print ","20"," to the output log, as that was the default value for the argument set by the child constructor, and the same value was passed into the parent constructor."," ","For more details on the ","new"," and ","delete"," operators, please see the following pages:"," ","new"," ","delete"],[" ","You can use ","is_instanceof"," to check if a struct belongs to the given constructor, or has the constructor as a parent constructor."," ","function item() constructor {}"," ","\n    function potion() : item() constructor {}"," ","\n    function enemy() constructor {}"," ","\n    var _potion = new potion();"," ","\n    show_debug_message(is_instanceof(_potion, potion)); // true (1)","\n    show_debug_message(is_instanceof(_potion, item)); // true (1)","\n    show_debug_message(is_instanceof(_potion, enemy)); // false (0)\n  "," ","The above code shows three constructors: ","item",", ","potion"," which is a child of ","item",", and ","enemy",", which is a separate constructor."," ","It creates a struct from the ","potion"," constructor.
