It is made up of ","19"," bits that store the tile index in the tile set (bits 0 to 18) plus a few extra bits to indicate how the tile data should be drawn: bit 28 stores the mirror bit, bit 29 stores the flip bit, bit 30 stores the rotate bit and bit 31 is unused. Bits 19 to 27 are also unused. You can also use these unused bits to store your own data."," ","For more convenient access to certain bits you can use the values of the tile mask constant: "," ","Tile Mask Constant"," ","Constant"," ","Description"," ","tile_rotate"," ","Used to set/get the rotate bit of a tile data blob."," ","tile_mirror"," ","Used to set/get the mirror bit of a tile data blob."," ","tile_flip"," ","Used to set/get the flip bit of a tile data blob."," ","tile_index_mask"," ","A special constant that is for \"and\"-ing with the tile data blob to extract the ","19"," bits of the tile index."," ","You can get tile data at a specific map cell using ","tilemap_get"," or ","tilemap_get_at_pixel"," and set it using ","tilemap_set"," or ","tilemap_set_at_pixel","."],[" ","You have the possibility of adding your own bit mask to a tile map in order to use bits of the tile data \"blob\" for your own use, although this is for advanced users only as you will be masking off bits that are reserved for the tile index.

If the tile set has a number of tiles that's not a power of two, then round up to the nearest power of two to get the mask, for example a tile set that is 20x20 has 400 tiles, which you would round up to 512, and so get a mask index value of 511 ($1ff in hexadecimal). Apart from the index mask, normally you would want to preserve the flip, rotate and mirror values that are assigned to a tile too, to help with that there are the constants under ","Tile Mask Constant"," that can be used.
