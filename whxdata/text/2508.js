The following options exist:"," ","Default sprite origin",": This option permits you to set the default origin position for any new sprite assets that you create. The default value is the Top Left."," ","Default sprite collision mask kind",": This option permits you to set the default kind of collision mask to use for new sprites. Choices are ","rectangle",", ","rotated rectangle",", ","ellipse",", ","diamond",", or ","precise"," / ","precise per frame."," The default is ","rectangle","."," ","Default sprite animation mode",": This option permits you to set the default animation mode for sprites in the Sprite Editor. You can choose either \"","Frames per second","\" or \"","Frames per game frame","\", with the default setting being \"","Frames per second","\"."," ","Default sprite animation speed",": This option permits you to set the default animation speed value for when you create a new sprite asset. Note that this value is linked to the animation mode and - for example - 3 frames per second is not the same as 30 frames per game frame, so be sure to set this value correctly in reference to the preferred mode. Default value is 30."," ","Default sprite animation speed when added to an asset layer",": Determines the default speed of a sprite when it's added to an ","Asset Layer in a room",", which functions as a multiplier (1 will play at the same speed as defined in the Sprite's properties, 2 will play twice as fast, 0 will make it static, etc.)"," ","Default sprite width",": This option permits you to set the default width for all new sprites created.

Default value is 64."," ","Default sprite SWF precision",": This option sets the default precision for the SWF precision slider. Default value is 50."," ","Apply resize and scale to sprite origin",": When checked this option will change the origin of the sprite when the sprite is resized or scaled, with the new origin being moved/scaled to match the new values for the sprite. Note that this is only applicable for custom sprite origins that are not locked in the sprite editor. If the origin is locked or the sprite uses one of the default positions - e.g.: \"Center\" or \"Top Left\", etc. - then this option will be grayed out and unavailable for changing.

This option lets you suppress this message and\n        always either cancel the import by selecting \"No\", or overwrite the current sprite by selecting \"Yes\". Default value is \"Show Message\"."," ","Automatic response to image load failure: When you import a new image and and the import fails, by default you will be shown a warning message informing you that there has been a failure.
