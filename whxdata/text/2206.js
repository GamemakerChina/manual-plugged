It also serves files for the ","GameMaker"," manual when used offline."," ","When you run a game on a target that requires the Micro Web Server, you will see a new window open as the game is served to the chosen device:"," ","NOTE"," The first time you run a game on a target that requires the Micro Web Server, you may get a firewall alert. You should permit the web server to communicate through the firewall if this happens."," ","When the Micro Web Server is running, you can access your game from any local device (and even remotely, if port forwarding is properly set up). Simply access your computer's local IP address through the port shown in this window, and you will be able to play your game from another device, like a mobile phone, or another computer."," ","For example, let's say your computer's local IP address is ","192.168.0.110"," (","read this"," to know how to find it), and the port shown in the Micro Web Server window is ","51264",". After running the game on your computer, you would connect to ","192.168.0.110:51264"," from a browser on your mobile, and play your game."," ","The Web Server will show a certain amount of debug information related to the files that have been served, and has a button to clear this at the bottom. Beside the \"Clear\" button is the path to the root JS file for the project, while underneath that you have the ","Network Speed"," option. This is set to \"No Limit\" by default, but clicking it will open up a list of different network options:"," ","Changing this setting will also change the package ","Size ","option to the right. You can also edit this manually, in which case the Network Speed will be set to \"Custom\". Setting it to anything other than the maximum value will effectively throttle the network transfer speed and permit you to test games in a low bandwidth environment."," ","You can also see the list of ","Allowed IPs"," along with the ","Port ","number being used, but these cannot be edited in the Micro Web Server.
