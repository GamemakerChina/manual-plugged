For more information this, please see the following section:"," ","The File System"," ","You can turn off sandboxing on the desktop targets (Windows, macOS and Ubuntu (Linux)) from the Game Options for the chosen platform, meaning that you can then save and load from anywhere, within the limits of the OS permissions."," ","If you have been granted permission by Steam to use their dedicated API with your game, you will find that there is also a new set of file functions available to you. These are explained in the ","Steam API"," section of this manual."," ","Finally, you should also note that there are some distinct differences between certain target platforms which would be taken into account when using the file functions. These are:"," ","iOS",": On iOS, if you are loading an included file from a folder, ie: with a path something like \"","Backgrounds/background1.png","\", you do NOT need to include the folder as part of the path and simply supplying the file name is sufficient. On all other platforms you must supply the folder(s) as part of the path to the file."," ","macOS and Ubuntu (Linux)",": On the macOS and Ubuntu, filenames and paths are case sensitive on these platforms, and so to prevent any potential issues, ","GameMaker"," will automatically make all names/paths use lower case by default."," ","HTML5",": On HTML5, saving and loading to and from ","local storage"," will work as explained within the different function pages, however if you are loading a file from a server, you ","must only use the function ","buffer_load_async()"," as loading synchronously has been deprecated on most browsers and will eventually be obsoleted.
