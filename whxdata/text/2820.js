However surfaces that you make yourself are different, since you can clear a surface to have any alpha value from zero to one that you wish. This leads to some interesting effects that are contrary to what most people would expect."," ","To illustrate this, we are going to look at drawing using the basic default ","bm_normal",". Most people think that having a surface cleared to alpha 0, and then drawing something with an alpha of 0.5 will give a resulting alpha value 0.5 too... ","but this is not the case"," and is something that many people think is a \"bug\" in how ","GameMaker"," renders things. However, as you will see, it's not a bug at all!"," ","Say you have surface with every pixel at alpha 0, then you draw a circle on it with alpha 0.5 using the ","bm_normal"," blend mode. The entire surface is still going to be alpha 0, but in the circle the alpha will actually be 0.25, since:"," ","0.5 * 0.5 + 0 * 0.5 = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25"," ","If you then proceed to draw another circle in the existing circle, also with an alpha of 0.5, then the alpha outside the circles would be 0, in between the circles 0.25, and in the smaller circle it would be 0.375:"," ","0.5 * 0.5 + 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375"," ","If you were to continue to draw a number of 0.5 alpha circles to a surface with 0 alpha, and then draw this surface to the room, you would be able to clearly see this:"," ","If you are still a bit confused about the alpha, try to picture it as just another colour. It behaves like a colour and all calculations on it are done in a similar manner. It's just not really visible, although the effect it has on other colours is. Which brings us to the final thing to note when using surfaces and blend modes (even ","bm_normal",")..."," ","Even if the alpha of the surface is 0, ","the colour components are still there and exist and will influence in all blending operations",". So drawing to a zero alpha cleared surface that has been cleared using the colour red (for example) will blend the source colours with the destination colours and give different effects to what you may think. The above image was created on a surface cleared to black, but if we clear the surface to red, we get this instead:"," ","Hopefully you can now work out why this happens for yourself using the formulas we've outlined above and applying the appropriate figures for ","bm_normal","."," ","Back: ","Additional Information"," ","Next: ","Guide To Using JSON"]],"6":[[" ","© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2024 All Rights Reserved"]],"7":[[" ","Denoting Components"],[" ","Calculating The Final Pixel"],[" ","Using Equations"]],"8":[[" ","Overview"],[" ","How Things Are Drawn"],[" ","Calculating Final Colour"],[" ","Basic Blend Modes"],[" ","Extended Blend Modes (Factors)"],[" ","Creating Your Own Blend Modes"],[" ","Blend Equations"],[" ","Surfaces And Alpha"]],"id":"2820"})
