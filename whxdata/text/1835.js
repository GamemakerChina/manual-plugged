The tile data is simply a value that reflects the index of the tile along with the transforms applied as well as any custom tile masks that you have used, and this action permits you to change three of those values: Flip, mirror and rotate. Note that you will normally want to get the tile data first using either ","Get Tile Data In Cell"," or ","Get Tile Data At Pixel",", then apply the required transform(s) and then set the tile in the tile map again using ","Set Tile Data In Cell"," or ","Set Tile Data At Pixel",", since this action ","only sets a value but does not apply it to the tile it was taken from",".
