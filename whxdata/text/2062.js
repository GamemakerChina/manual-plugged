You can define how precise the drawing of the corners is with the function ","draw_set_circle_precision()",", but this function uses a fixed radius for them (should you need to change the corner radius, use the function ","draw_roundrect_ext()","). Please note that the rectangle being drawn may need different values (+/-1 on the x, y, or width or height) to be drawn with the desired dimensions due to differences across the various supported platforms."," ","NOTE",": If you are wanting to draw a shape using a shader, you should be aware that most shaders expect the following inputs: vertex, texture, Colour. However, when using this function, only vertex and colour data are being passed in, and so the shader may not draw anything (or draw something but not correctly).
