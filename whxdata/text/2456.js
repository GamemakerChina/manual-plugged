This DS map will contain different values depending on the data being returned, ie: the event will trigger multiple times as each packet of data is received so that you can show a progress bar, for example. The general structure for the DS map will be as follows:"," ","id: ","The ID which was returned from the command.

This returns the standard web status code for most browsers, eg: 304 for \"Not Modified\" or 204 for \"No Content\", etc..."," ","If there are multiple packets being returned to your game, the callback \"status\" key will return 1, in which case the DS map will have the following additional keys:"," ","\"contentLength\": ","This is the size of file that the web server has said you should expect to receive (may be -1 if the server does not return this data)."," ","\"sizeDownloaded\": ","The size of the data that has already been downloaded."],[" ","http_get_file(url, local_target);"," ","Argument"," ","Type"," ","Description"," ","url"," ","String"," ","The web address of the server that you wish to get file from"," ","local_target"," ","String"," ","The local storage path to save the file to"],[" ","Async Request ID"],[" ","The ","http_get_file()"," function can be called from any event, and since it is asynchronous the callback can be almost instantaneous or could take several seconds. Calling the function is simple and would look something like this:"," ","file = http_get_file(\"http://www.macsweeneygames.com/downloads/upgrade.zip\", \"\\Downloads\\Upgrade.zip\");"," ","The above code will request a file from the given URL and set it to be downloaded to the local storage area (as specified in the HTML5 Game Options), in a directory \"Downloads\" with the given file name (this does not have to be the same as the source file name, but should use the same file extension). The ","async_load"," map index will be stored in the variable \"file\" so you can check for the correct callback in the Asynchronous Event, and if the save directory does not exist, it will be created.
