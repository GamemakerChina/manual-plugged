You can choose to flag this variable as being a temporary local variable, but that will mean that it is discarded at the end of the action script or event, meaning that the emitter will still exist but leave\n    you without any means to access it, so care must be taken when using this (in general emitters will never need to be stored in a temporary local variable, but for certain things, like drawing particles to a surface, it may be required)."," ","IMPORTANT!"," If your particle system is ","persistent"," then you must either destroy all emitters at the end of each room using ","Destroy Particle Emitter"," and re-create them again in the next room as required,\n    or store their ID values in ","global"," variables so that they can be accessed anytime in any room, or have them created by a persistent object, so that the object will persist and be able to access them through instance variables. Also note that\n    if you call the ","Restart Game"," action you should destroy the particle system beforehand so that the system and the emitters assigned are removed from memory before starting again.
