The tile data is simply a value that reflects the index of the tile along with the flip, mirror, and rotate values, as well as any custom tile masks that you have used. With this action you first supply the layer to target using the name of the layer (a string) as defined in the room editor, and then the x and y axis in the room to set the tile data for. Note that the tile data will be set for the tile map \"cell\" in which the given position lands. For example, if your tile set tiles are 16x16, then the tile map layer will hold tiles in cells of 16x16 pixels, so if you use this action to target the room position (8, 8), you will be changing the tile in the cell (0, 0) of the tile map."," ","NOTE"," The layer selected ","must"," have been defined as a Tile Map Layer in ","The Room Editor",", otherwise you may get errors."," ","The final argument for the action is the tile data itself.
