Temporary variables are very useful for storing values that are only needed for a single operation and prevent your objects becoming \"cluttered\" with variables that may only be used once. They are also very useful for breaking down complex operations, or for setting values in other instances when you change the action scope. This is because variables declared as temporary are","not","scoped to any particular instance, but instead scoped to the event or script itself, so if you create a temporary variable and then change the action scope using the ","Apply To..."," action, you can still check the temporary variable without issues and without changing its action scope."," ","It is worth noting that when we talk about \"values\", we don't just mean numeric values, as a variable can be a string, a pointer, a resource ID or anything else that a function can return or use, even an ","expression",". See the section on ","data types"," for more information."," ","Note that many action have a \"Temp\" check-box which enables you to create a new temporary local variable to hold the return value of the action, and this variable can be accessed in the action script or event as you would any other variable thereafter.
