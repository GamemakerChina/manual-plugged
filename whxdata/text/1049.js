You would adjust this value if you were saving your project and the File Watcher was\n      erroneously appearing saying something had changed, in which case you would increase the delay until the message no longer appears. The default value is 2000ms, but can range from 1ms up to 10,000ms. "," ","Back: ","General Preferences"," ","Next: ","Go To Preferences"]],"6":[[" ","© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2024 All Rights Reserved"]],"id":"1049"})
