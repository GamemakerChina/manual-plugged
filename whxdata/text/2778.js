In general this option is used for testing due to its faster build times, but it does not offer the same performance boost that using the YYC option (if available) offers. You can use this to compile executable packages for smaller games or games where performance is not ever going to be an issue."," ","YYC",": The YYC (","YoYo Compiler",") generates C++ code from your GML code, before using the target's C++ compiler to compile it into native code for the target platform. It strips out unneeded functions and performs a host of other optimisation techniques to create a smaller and performance-enhanced executable package."," ","\n        This can increase your game's performance by at least two or three times, especially on logic-heavy games, and is ideal for those larger or CPU-intensive projects. Compile times may take longer and you should always clear the compiler cache before building any final complete asset package for a target platform. Note that the YYC target may require extra tools to be installed for the platform selected, otherwise it will not work - you can find further information about this from the ","YoYo Games Help Center"," as well as on the individual ","target Preferences"," pages detailed in this manual.\n      "," ","JavaScript",": The JavaScript target will only be available for specific targets, like the HTML5 target, and sets the game to be compiled to pure JavaScript.
