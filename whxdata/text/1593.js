It is also commonly used to check the integrity of files and strings.\n    This function will take an input UTF-8 string (which has a variable number of bytes per character) and return the 32-character hexadecimal MD5 hash that is unique to that string. In this way you can generate a secure key which can be stored and used\n    to check the integrity of the information being sent to (or received from) an external server (for example)."," ","NOTE",": There are two formats for the MD5 encoding, UTF-8 and unicode.
