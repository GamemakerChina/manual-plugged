For example, we may have added a value to the image index of a sprite and expect the result to be a single integer (5), but due to the nature of floating point maths, the actual final value ends up being something like 5.000002, so when we have the following check:"," ","if image_index == 5","\n    {","\n        //do something","\n    }"," ","The code does not behave as expected and returns ","false",".
