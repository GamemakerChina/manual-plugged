Should you need to change the corner radius you should use the function ","draw_roundrect_colour_ext()",". Please note that the rectangle being drawn may need different values (+/-1 on the x, y, or width or height) to be drawn with the desired dimensions due to differences across the various supported platforms."," ","NOTE",": If you are wanting to draw a shape using a shader, you should be aware that most shaders expect the following inputs: vertex, texture, Colour.
