Additionally, if your game does many texture lookups and t","he platform it's running on does not have sufficient graphics memory bandwidth to handle the texture reading at a high frame rate, the game may slow down."," ","GameMaker"," has two ways to allow for texture compression and decompression. Texture compression is set per ","texture group"," and works differently according to the format used: "," ","BZ + ","QOI",", ","QOI",", ","PNG"," - The asset compiler compresses all textures in the texture group to the given format and stores them with the game. When they are loaded from disk into RAM, they remain compressed while in RAM. When a texture from this texture group format is then fetched into VRAM, it is decompressed on the CPU and this decompressed data stored in VRAM."," ","Custom"," - GPU texture compression. The textures are generated at compile time using an external tool that compresses the textures to a format optimised for decompressing on the GPU and are then stored with the game. When a texture of this format is loaded into RAM, it remains compressed there. When it's fetched into VRAM, the texture data still remains compressed. The texture is decompressed by the GPU in real time when it performs texel lookups on the texture."," ","The following image shows a comparison of different texture formats: "," ","A comparison of different texture group formats.","\n      From left to right: BZ2 + QOI (no GPU texture compression), BC7 and BC3."],[" ","The textures are stored in a compressed format in VRAM and are decompressed in real time by the GPU."," ","Custom GPU texture compression is done using an extension: ","GM-GPUTextureCompression",".

This is the most common form of GPU compression and is supported in some format on almost all modern platforms. When the GPU texture is generated from the original image using e.g. BCN compression, it is subdivided into fixed-size blocks of 4x4 pixels or texels (other compression algorithms support different block sizes). The information in the pixels in this block is converted to a 128 bit value. When the GPU reads back this value, it restores the colour value of the requested pixel from it as precisely as possible.
