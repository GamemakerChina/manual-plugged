The option is visible when your text cursor is placed on a function header (i.e. the line where the function's name is defined)."," ","The format for a typical function header would be to have the function name, the description of the function, and then the list of the different arguments (parameters) that the function takes, making sure to start each line with a triple forward slash \"","///","\" as that tells ","GameMaker"," to parse the comment as being JSDoc style. You can alternatively wrap your JSDoc comments in ","/**"," ... ","*/",", with the ","/**"," being on its own line."," ","The comments themselves need to be given an identifier (preceded by \"","@","\") and content.
