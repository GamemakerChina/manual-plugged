The certificate form consists of the following sections for when you have already created a certificate (see\n    further down this page for details on how to create a certificate):"," ","Certificate File",": This section is where you specify the ","*.pem"," file that the Marketplace uses for certification of assets. If you have a previously created certificate then you can click the file browser\n      button here and add it in to the forum, but if you do not have a certificate and wish to make one, then you should omit any information here and instead click to the ","Create New Certificate"," button (explained below)."," ","Certificate Password",": Here you must input the certificate password for the file selected above. The password is created when you first create the ","*.pem"," file (see ","Create A New Certificate",",\n      below) and will be irreversibly linked to the certificate file created."," ","Check",": Once you have filled in the above fields you should click this button to ensure that the password and file selection are correct and work together."," "," ","Confirm Dialogs"," "," ","Here you can select the behaviour of the confirmation dialogues when working with a resource from the Asset Browser.

Within the Marketplace dashboard you can set up different publishers if you require and each one should have it's own corresponding *.pem\n      certificate file."," ","Certificate Password",": Here you must give a unique password for the certificate file to be created. Take care with what you choose as you cannot change it later and if you do not have the correct password for the certificate file in\n      the sections above you will not be able to update any existing Marketplace assets (nor upload new ones)."," ","With those details given you can then click on the ","Create Certificate"," button to\n    generate the ","*.pem"," file.

Both should be saved together to a safe location for future reference, or in case you need to\n    re-install ","GameMaker"," at some point. You cannot update assets that have already been uploaded unless the updated package is signed using the same certificate that the original was created with."," ","Back: ","IDE Preferences"," ","Next: ","Plugin Preferences"]],"6":[[" ","© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2024 All Rights Reserved"]],"id":"2458"})
