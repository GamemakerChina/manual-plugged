Note that ","regardless"," of whether this option is checked or not, if you have set the action to ","Return List",", then the target variable will ","always contain a list ID",", and as such, this will need to be freed when the instance is destroyed or the room ends (you can use the ","Clean Up"," event for this, for example, along with the ","Free Data Structure"," ","action).
