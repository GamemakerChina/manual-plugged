Unlike the normal ","font_add_sprite()"," which has a specific order for the sub-images of the sprite, this function will map the sprite sub-images based on the argument \"string_map\" of the function. This argument is a string that you can use to tell ","GameMaker"," what order the sub-images of the sprite font are and it will map these automatically when writing text. So, for example, if you have a string-map of \"AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHh\", your sprite font ","must"," have the sub-images ordered in this way. You can define \"space\" as being any character you want, for example a single line the size that you want the space to be, and all spaces in text will be rendered at that width (but the image chosen will ","never"," be rendered), or if you don't supply a sprite for space then the width of the widest character in the sprite font will be used instead."," ","You can also set the spacing for the font to be proportional (","true",") or not (","false","), where a proportional font is spaced based on the actual width of the letters (so the letter \"i\" takes less room than the letter \"w\", for example) while a non-proportional font will be spaced based on the sub-image width, like a monospaced font. Finally, you can define the space to leave between each letter when writing, and this can be any integer value, with 0 being no space (the letters will \"touch\" if proportional)."," ","The function returns an ","index"," value that should be stored in a variable as this will be needed in all further codes that refer to this font, or it will return -1 if the function fails for any reason."," ","It is worth noting that for the font alignment functions to work (like ","draw_set_halign()",") then the font sprite should have its origin set to the ","top left corner",".
