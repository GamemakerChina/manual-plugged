A buffer is a region of physical memory used to temporarily hold data while it's being moved from one place to another or manipulated in some way. For example, you can use a buffer to hold packet data awaiting transmission over a network or for storing a packet that has been received over a network."],[" ","Before using ","buffers"," please note the following points: "," ","When a buffer is created, it is automatically cleared and filled to 0."," ","The \"size\" argument of the buffer functions always refers to the size ","in bytes"," of the buffer."," ","The \"alignment\" argument refers to how data is stored within a buffer. If your alignment is set to say, 4, and you write a single piece of data which is 1 byte in size then do a ","buffer_tell",", you'll get an offset of 1. However, if you write another piece of data, also 1 byte in size, then do a ","buffer_tell",", you'll get an offset of 5 as the alignment has \"padded\" the data to that size. Alignment only affects ","where"," things are written to, so if you do a ","buffer_tell"," after you write something, it'll return the current write position which immediately follows the data you've written. Note, however, that if you then write another piece of data, internally the buffer will move the write position along to the next multiple of the alignment size before actually writing the piece of data."," ","When dealing with \"offset\", this is the value ","in bytes"," to offset the data by within the given buffer. So if your buffer is 2 byte aligned and you want to skip the first 4 aligned places, you would have an offset of ","2 * 4 bytes","."," ","Some of the buffer functions also create a new buffer (like ","buffer_load"," for example).
