However this function also has two additional options that permit you to set the icon alpha from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque) and the scale of the icon, which is a multiplier value applied to the sprite used. So a value of 1 is the default scale, while (for example) 0.5 would be half scale and 2 would be double."," ","It is also worth noting that if the URL argument you pass in is the name of a ","script function"," (ie: it doesn't start with \"http://\") AND the script is called ","gmcallback_*"," then you can get direct feeds into an html5 event.
