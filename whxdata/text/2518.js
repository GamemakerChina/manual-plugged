You can also set the ","App Output"," location on the build Mac, and you can give the ","Team Identifier"," that you wish to use for signing the final application that ","GameMaker"," creates for you.

For crisp pixel graphics, it should be off, but if you have nice alpha blends and smoothed edged graphics it is better left on. This is off by default."," ","Scaling",": Here you can select to scale the draw canvas maintaining the aspect ratio within the device screen - adding \"padding\" around the edges to fit the screen - or you can select to have the draw canvas stretched to fit the device screen."," ","Next there is the option to set the size of the ","texture page",". The default (and most compatible) size is 2048x2048, but you can choose from anywhere between 256x256 up to 8192x8192. There is also a button marked ","Preview ","which will generate the texture pages for this platform and then open a window so that you can see how they look. This can be very useful if you wish to see how the texture pages are structured and to prevent having texture pages larger (or smaller) than necessary. For more information on texture pages, please see ","here","."," ","NOTE"," Be aware that the larger the size of the texture page, the less compatible your game will be with different browsers and devices."," ","Finally, you choose to ","Display a cursor"," or not.
