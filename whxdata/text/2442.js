You select the view port variable to edit, then give the view port to target (from 0 to 7) and finally the new value\n    for the variable. The view port is the area of the screen that will be used to draw a given camera view (as set up in the room editor), and the different variables that you are able to set in this way are outlined in the table below:"," ","Variable"," ","Description"," ","Camera"," ","This is for setting the viewport to show a different Camera View.

Note though that is is only really required when more than one view port is active - for example to create a split screen effect - and if used when only one port is active you get\n          unexpected results."," ","View Port Y Coordinate"," ","This is the Y position of the view port within the game window.
