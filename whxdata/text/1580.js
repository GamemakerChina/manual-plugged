For example, if a ","DS Grid"," is accessed at a\n    coordinate outside of the defined size, in developer mode you would get a compiler window error message but the checks in place would permit the game to continue running. However in release mode these checks will not be there and so the code could\n    return either a NULL pointer, or a bad pointer which in turn will point to some random memory. So at best you could get the wrong data returned, or at worst you could overwrite something in memory - data, graphics, or even code itself. Another example\n    would be when building primitives - if you supply the colour, position, texture, etc... data in a different order to that which you defined when you created the vertex format, then the game may crash or produce unexpected results when release mode\n    is on."],[" ","gml_release_mode(flag);"," ","Argument","Type"," ","Description"," ","flag","Boolean"," ","Either ","true"," to set release mode or false for general development."],[" ","N/A"],[" ","gml_release_mode(true);"," ","The above example code will set the game to use release mode when compiled."," ","Back: ","OS And Compiler"," ","Next: ","gml_pragma"]],"4":[[" ","Â© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2023 All Rights Reserved"]],"5":[["gml_release_mode"]],"6":[[" ","Syntax:"],[" ","Returns:"],[" ","Example:"]],"id":"1580"})
