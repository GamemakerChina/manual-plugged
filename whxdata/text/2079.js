In this way, you can have (for example) a bomb change into an explosion - in which case the \"perf\" argument would probably be true as you would want the bomb to perform its Destroy Event and Clean Up Event, as well as the explosion to perform its Create Event - or you could have your player character change into a different one - in which case the \"perf\" argument would probably be false as you do not want the instances to perform their Create and Destroy/Clean Up events."," ","It is worth noting that changing the instance means that you should perform no further actions with that instance until the next step, in particular trying to access variables etc... as that will cause an error.
