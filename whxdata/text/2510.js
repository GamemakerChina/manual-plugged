It should be noted that these functions should ","never be run from within the room that you wish to change",", but rather be run from an instance in another room first. Also note that if you change any room asset in this way, the change is ","permanent"," and will be maintained for the entire duration of the game, even if you call the room_restart() function (closing and restarting the game will reset the room properties though)."," ","room_exists"," ","room_add"," ","room_duplicate"," ","room_assign"," ","room_instance_add"," ","room_instance_clear"," ","room_set_height"," ","room_set_width"," ","room_set_persistent"," ","room_set_view_enabled"," ","room_set_viewport"," ","room_get_viewport"," ","room_set_camera"," ","room_get_camera"," ","There are also a number of different functions related to creating and manipulating the different types of elements that can be placed on layers in the room. These functions are listed in the appropriate sections for each element type listed below:"," ","General Layer Functions"," ","Tile Map Layers"," ","Background Layers"," ","Sprite Layers"," ","Sequence Layers"," ","Filter and Effect Functions"," ","An important thing to note when creating room layers is that ","you can have multiple different element types on one layer",". So, for example, you may have a layer for enemies, and on that layer have the enemy instances as well as certain sprite assets that are only related to that enemy. Or you could have a background element with a tile map element to create the look of a room. This is not permitted in the room editor, but when creating things dynamically you can do this, which is why functions like ","layer_get_all_elements()"," exist."," ","Back: ","Asset Management"," ","Next: ","Extensions"]],"4":[[" ","© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2023 All Rights Reserved"]],"id":"2510"})
