Additive blending is a special blend mode that adds the luminosity values of each particle as they overlap, so that light colours will gradually get brighter (until they appear white) as they overlap, and dark colours become more and more transparent with black being almost invisible. This function can give some beautiful particle effects but may not always be necessary.
