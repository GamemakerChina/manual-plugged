These types of errors can be quite hard to debug and so it is always good to be aware of them and to plan ahead and use other means of checking values or to use the appropriate flooring or rounding functions (listed below) to convert the number to check into an integer (for more information on floating point maths and why this is an issue, please ","see here","). For example the above code could be written as:"," ","if (floor(image_index) == 1)","\n    {","\n        do something...","\n    }"," ","It is also worth noting that when using the ","YoYo Compiler"," targets, all expressions and functions are ","evaluated from left to right",", while on all other target platforms they are evaluated ","from right to left",", meaning that this - for example - will give different results depending on the platform:"," ","val = max(num, ++num, num++);"," ","NOTE"," For more information, see the section on ","Evaluation Order","."," ","You can also use a special function available in ","GameMaker"," to set the ","epsilon"," value for floating point maths.
