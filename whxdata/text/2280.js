This works by taking the maximum input values for force and torque and applying those to the second fixture to bring the speed and angular momentum down to the same values as that of the first instance. So, if you have a stationary instance and a moving instance then connect them with a friction joint, the moving instance will gradually slow down until it too is stationary. If both instances were moving then the second instance will have its movement speed modified to match that of the first instance."," ","As with most other joints, you supply the instances to join together, as well as the position for the joint to be created at within the room.
