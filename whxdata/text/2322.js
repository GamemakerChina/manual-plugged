The simplest of these is the ","repeat"," statement, which has the form:"," ","repeat (<expression>)","\n    {","\n        <statement>;","\n        <statement>;","\n        ...","\n    }"," ","With ","repeat"," the given ","statement"," is repeated the number of times indicated by the rounded value of the ","expression",". For example, the following creates five balls at random positions:"," ","repeat (5)","\n    {","\n        instance_create_layer(random(400), random(400), \"Instances\", obj_ball);","\n    }"," ","This can be very useful to avoid typing out the same code multiple times, or for using arrays, or for counting through a number of operations etc... You are not limited to using a single statement either, and can repeat multiple statements by enclosing them within curly brackets ","{}",". For example:"," ","var _x = 32;","\n    repeat (global.p_lives)","\n    {","\n        draw_sprite(spr_heart, 0, _x, 32);","\n        _x += sprite_get_width(spr_heart);","\n    }"," ","The above example repeats the statements in the curly brackets for however many ","iteration","s"," the \"lives\" global variable has, and each iteration draws the heart sprite at the ","_x"," position, then moves the position along a bit based on the heart sprite width."," ","When should you use a ","repeat"," loop?"," Anytime that you want to repeat over one or more statements a fixed number of times without any specific need to maintain a count of the iterations."," ","It is worth noting that you can use the special ","break"," and ","continue"," statements within a ","repeat"," loop too. Using ","break"," will immediately exit the loop and move on to any code that is in the event or function after the loop should have finished, eg:"," ","var i = 0;","\n    var temp = 0;","\n    repeat (10)","\n    {","\n        temp += array[i];","\n        if (temp > max_total)","\n        {","\n            break;","\n        }","\n        else","\n        {","\n            i += 1;","\n        }","\n    }"," ","The above code loops through 10 ","array"," values and adds them to a local variable. If the total of the local variable is greater than the given value for ","max_total",", then the loop is terminated using break, otherwise the loop will continue. "," ","An example of using ","continue"," in a ","repeat"," loop would be:"," ","repeat(10)","\n    {   ","\n        var _x = random(room_width);","\n        var _y = random(room_height);","\n        if (instance_position(_x, y, obj_Enemy)","\n        {","\n            continue;","\n        }","\n        instance_create_layer(_x, _y, \"Instances\", obj_Enemy);","\n    }"," ","This code will repeat 10 times, generating a random room position then checking if an instance of the object ","obj_Enemy"," exists at that position. If it does, the current loop iteration is terminated using ","continue"," and a new iteration is started, and if it doesn't then an instance of the object ","obj_Enemy"," is created at the random position."," ","For more examples of loop functions please see the sections on ","while",", ","do... until",", and ","for","."," ","Back: ","Language Features"," ","Next: ","while"]],"6":[[" ","© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2024 All Rights Reserved"]],"id":"2322"})
