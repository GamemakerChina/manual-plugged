Like any programming language, ","GML"," uses them."," ","They are used to store information in the device's memory for later (or instant) use, and given a name so you can refer to them in ","runtime"," and ","script functions","."," ","A variable in ","GML"," can store many different ","Data Types",", like a real number (e.g.: 100, 2.456575, -56, etc.), a string (e.g.: \"Hello world!\"), an integer (e.g.: 1, 556, -7), or a boolean (","true"," or ","false","), as well as other things:"," ","var _num = 126.4545;","\n    var _str = \"Hello World\";","\n    new_num = _num * 100;","\n    global.my_string = _str + \" I said\";"," ","You can also use variables to hold the values returned from functions, for example:"," ","var _id = instance_nearest(x, y, obj_Tree);","\n    root = sqrt(1000);","\n    global.str = string_upper(\"Hello World\");"," ","So, a variable is something that we can name and use to store a value for later use in one or more operations."," ","A good \"real world\" example of a variable is the speed of something, e.g. the speed of a car. A car's speed is clearly ","variable",", because at some point in time the car will be standing still (i.e. its speed is equal to 0), at another point in time the car will be driving (i.e. its speed is greater than 0). When the car accelerates or slows down, its speed changes. So it makes sense that if you want to store the car's speed in a ","GameMaker"," game that you store it in a ","variable",". In the game, you'd e.g. set the variable to 0 when the game starts and change it whenever you want the car to change its speed."],[" ","When forming variables in ","GML"," they must have a name that starts with a letter or the underscore symbol \"_\" and can contain only letters, numbers, and the underscore symbol '_' with a maximum length of 64 symbols. So, valid variables are things like ","fish",", ","foo_bar",", ","num1",", or ","_str",", while invalid variables would be ","6fish",", ","foo bar",", or ","*num","."," ","Now, in many programming languages you need to create a variable \"assignment\" before you can use it. This basically means that you tell the computer the name you wish to use for the variable and assign it an initial value. The variable is then given a place in memory to store the value or perform operations on it. Assigning a variable takes the form of:"," ","<variable> = <expression>;"," ","An expression can be a simple value but can also be more complicated, so, rather than assigning a value to a variable, one can also add a value to the current value of the variable using ","+=",", for example:"," ","a = 100;   // Assigning a simple value","\n    b = 200;","\n    c = 300;","\n    a += b;    // Assigning with operation","\n    a = b + c; // Assigning with expression"," ","NOTE"," The GameMaker Language will also accept \"",":=","\" for assignments, although this is not typically the most common way to do it:"," ","<variable> := <expression>;"," ","Similarly, you can subtract using ","-=",", multiply using ","*=",", divide using ","/=",", or use bitwise operators using ","|=",", ","&=",", or ","^=",".
