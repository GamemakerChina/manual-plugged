Ideally the sprite being used to generate the new alpha map should be grey-scale, with the white areas having an equivalent alpha value of 1 (opaque), the black areas being equivalent to alpha 0 (transparent), and the grey areas being an alpha in between 0 and 1. The sprite that you are setting the alpha of ","cannot be a permanent resource",", nor can the sprite you use to set the alpha, as this will give an error.
