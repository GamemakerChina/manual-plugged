This will open the Asset Explorer where you can select the required curve from the ones presented to you:"," ","It is important to note that the animation curve asset ","must have the correct number of channels for the track it is being applied to",", as each\n    type of parameter track will require a different number of channels in the animation curve. Any animation curves that do not have enough channels will be shown with a "," indicator in the asset browser."," ","Below is a list of the different parameter tracks and the channels that they will require in each curve asset (channels should be added in the order given for each parameter type):"," ","Position",": 2 channels, X and Y."," ","Rotation",": 1 channel."," ","Colour Multiply",": 4 channels, Alpha, Red, Green and Blue, and the range ","must"," be between 0 and 255."," ","Image Index",": 1 channel."," ","Image Speed",": 1 channel."," ","Origin",": 2 channels, X and Y."," ","Scale",": 2 channels, X scale and Y scale, and note that the value is a multiplier, so the base value is 1 (no scale) and greater than one will make the image bigger, and less than 1 will make it smaller.

In such a case the shared curve will appear as invalid in the dope sheet, and you can click on \"Add Channel(s)\" to create any\n    missing channels which will make the curve valid again:"," ","By default, the animation curve will be applied along the entire length of the asset key it is attached to, however, much like with keyframes, you can click "," on a curve and drag it to re-position it on the timeline, and you can also hold down the "," key and and drag to resize the length of the curve\n    (this also applies to ","embedded curves","):"," ","The other way to add a parameter curve to a track is to embed it. This can be done by either clicking the right mouse button\n    "," on the parameter track and selecting \"","Convert to Curve","\", or by clicking on the ","Toggle Curve Mode"," "," button, which will show you the track as an animation curve in the full dope sheet area, and you can then click the ","Convert To Curve"," button:"," ","Once you have converted the parameter keyframe track to a curve it can be edited within the dope sheet, exactly the same way\n    that you can edit ","animation curve assets",", this includes adding or removing points, changing their position, changing the curve type (linear, smooth or bezier), applying presets, and renaming channels and the colours\n    associated with them."," ","IMPORTANT",": You can also edit animation curve assets that have been applied to parameter tracks in this way, however any changes you make ","will be applied to all tracks that use the animation curve",", as you are editing\n    the curve asset and not a single copy of it.

This will convert the embedded\n    curve into a new asset which can then be edited as normal as well as applied to other parameter tracks if required."," ","The image above shows how the embedded animation curve editor looks, and it's very similar to the ","Animation Curve Editor",".

However, you should be aware that when doing this there are a couple of caveats. Keyframes\n      cannot be \"between\" frames, and so some curve values will need to be rounded to the nearest frame, which in turn will change the way the parameter track behaves. Also, if the parameter curve uses catmull-rom or bezier interpolation, ","this will be lost ","and\n      the interpolation between keyframes will be set to linear interpolation."," "," ","Curve Menu"," "," ","This menu contains options available elsewhere in the editor, but all in one place.
