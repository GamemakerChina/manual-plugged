The only exception to this rule is when a sprite asset has been flagged as being for a \"","Separate Texture Page","\", in which case it will be given its own individual texture page (see the section on \"Texture Settings\" in the ","Sprite Editor"," for more details)."],[" ","A single ","texture group"," can have multiple ","texture pages"," -- they are not equivalent."," ","If your game has a lot of unique graphics for each level, then you may define a single texture ","group ","for each of the levels, but the group's graphics may require two or more texture ","pages",". This depends on whether the selected texture page size (in the ","Game Options"," for your target) is able to fit all the graphics within a texture group."," ","See: ","Texture Pages"],[" ","You can set up Dynamic Texture Groups, which can be loaded and unloaded at runtime to save memory."," ","See: ","Dynamic Textures"],[" ","The ","group settings"," in the Texture Group Editor are used to determine exactly how the texture pages for a given group should be created, with the following options available:"," ","Allow Scaling"," - Unflagging this will force ","GameMaker"," to not scale the texture group under any circumstances. This can be useful, especially when dealing with universal apps, as it allows you to put specific resources like fonts in a group of its own to be used when the app is run on a specific device. For example, fonts can look great on a retina display, but when they are scaled down to draw on a normal display they can look terrible so you can assign them to a special non-scaling group - if developing for the iPhone, you may wish to have this checked, as apps have been rejected due to the images being blurred by texture scaling. This is flagged as ","on ","by default."," ","Automatically Crop"," - When you add images into ","GameMaker"," , if they have any \"space\" around them (ie 100% transparency) this is automatically cropped when it is added into the texture page and \"Automatically Crop\" is flagged. However, if, for example, you are using the image as a non-repeating texture for primitives or anything similar, this means that the UV coordinates for texture mapping are not going to be correctly represented. In these cases you can un-flag this option and the sprite will be added to the texture page \"as is\", maintaining any transparencies that it may have around the edges. This is flagged as ","on ","by default."," ","Generate Mipmaps"," - Flagging this option (it is off by default) will tell ","GameMaker"," that the original texture page is to be scaled and filtered into multiple resolutions within the texture file. This is normally ","off",", but if you are using cameras to zoom in or out on large areas of the game room, or you are working with a 3D game, then you may want to enable this and then use the ","Mipmapping Functions"," to adjust how the game deals with the different mipmap levels. When you flag this check box the \"Border Size\" value will be set to 8 (if it was set to less than 8 originally). This is because, when using mipmaps, you need larger borders between images on the texture pages otherwise they start bleeding together at higher mip levels. The default value of 8 will allow the image to be reduced to about an eighth of its original size before the sub-images start bleeding together, but you can change this to any value that is required to suit your needs. Note that if you are using the \"","Separate Texture Page","\" option for sprites, then you do not need to go through each texture here and flag it to generate mipmaps, but instead you can go to the ","General Game Options"," and flag the option \"","Generate mipmaps for separate texture pages","\"."," ","Border Size"," - The border size will change the overlap (or \"pixel doubling\") amount around the edges of all assets on the pages generated for the texture group so that when the images are scaled, there are no gaps (or seams) visible between them. The default is 2 pixels, but in extreme cases where you are zooming the view in or out a great deal then you may need to increase this value. Note that the ","Tile Set Editor"," has an option to set the output border for tiles (and also provides an explanation of why this is necessary), and this is separate to the border setting here - basically, tiles are generated with an output border for each tile on a temporary texture, and this is then added to the texture page with the border given here around the outside edge. Also note that enabling Mipmaps will automatically set the default border size for the texture page to 8 to help prevent \"bleeding\" between textures at higher mip levels, but this can be changed."," ","Parent Texture Group"," - Here you can choose any of the existing groups to be the \"parent\" group for the currently selected one. \"Child\" groups will inherit any changes made to the parent texture group and are primarily for resource management when working with cross platform games. A texture group with a parent is still a texture group in its own right and will generate texture pages the same as any other group, but assigning them a parent allows you to exclude large chunks for different platforms. For example, you can add a whole load of Android player sprites to a \"player\" group, and Android enemy sprites to an \"enemy\" group, then make them both use an \"android\" parent group. If you then exclude the \"android\" parent group from the Windows or other platform build, the child groups will be excluded too."," ","Texture Group Format"," - Here you can choose the format for your texture page, between ","BZ2 + QOI",", ","QOI"," and ","PNG",". It is recommended to stick with the default option, ","BZ2 + QOI",", as it offers the best compression while retaining quality."," ","\n      You can choose ","QOI"," if the BZ2 option affects speed on a target platform (e.g. Android), or ","PNG"," if you wish for the exported PNGs to be modified or use the ","PNGCrush option",".\n    "," ","Texture Group Type"," - Here you can set whether this is a regular Texture Group or a ","Dynamic Texture Group","."," ","Dynamic Group Path"," - Here you can set the path within the final game package where the texture group will be stored. This only works if the group is Dynamic. If this is empty, exported textures are placed at the root of the game package."," ","Other than those settings you can also choose to export (or not) any given texture group to any given platform by simply checking or un-checking the appropriate boxes from the ","Use Group On..."," section of the window. Note though that the ","<Default>"," texture group is ","always exported to every platform",", and you can't check/un-check any of them (only custom texture groups permit this)."," ","Texture Groups are also linked to the ","Configurations"," settings. What this means is that you can define texture groups for each individual configuration of your game, and then set the sprite, tile set or font resource assignments to these different groups and it will be \"remembered\" when you change to a different configuration. The same will happen to any export options that you have chosen in the Texture Group window, so you can set the texture groups to export to specific platforms on a per-configuration basis."," ","One use for this is, for example, that you could make an iPad configuration and for that create 2048x2048px texture pages (setting this up via the ","Game Options","). You would then assign all the graphics assets to the appropriate texture group, and when finished, you would then change to a different configuration (for HTML5, for example) and from the Texture Group window, create new texture groups that are 512x512px, assigning the assets to these new groups. There is also a button at the bottom of the page that permits you to copy texture group settings from one configuration to another."," ","Back: ","Game Settings"," ","Next: ","Game Options"]],"4":[[" ","© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2023 All Rights Reserved"]],"5":[["Texture Groups"]],"7":[[" ","How Textures Work"],[" ","Adding a Texture Group"],[" ","Editing a Texture Group"],[" ","Texture Group vs. Texture Page"],[" ","Dynamic Textures"],[" ","Group Settings"]],"id":"2701"})
