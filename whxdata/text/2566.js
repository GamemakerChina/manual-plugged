So, valid variables are things like ","fish",", ","foo_bar",", ","num1",", and ","invalid"," variables would be ","6fish",",\n    ","foo bar",", or ","*num",". Once you have given the name of the variable you need to set its type, which can be any of the following:","It is worth noting that this feature is particularly useful when working with parent/child instances - since you can have a parent object with a set of defined variables and then simply modify them in child object (see the section ","Object Variables And Child Objects","    below for more details) - and for when you add instances into the ","Room Editor"," (see the section on ","Layers ","> ","Instance Layer","), since you can also modify these variables for individual instances\n    that have been placed in the room."," ","The different types of variable that you can create are listed below:"," ","Real",": A real number is any number that is not a whole integer and can be positive or negative. So, ","124.5",", ","45639.566546456",", ","0.9",", ","-45.5","      etc... are all examples of real numbers.

Note that you can\n      set a range of values for the output integer, as explained above for real numbers."," ","String",": A string is anything that has been placed within double quotation marks, for example \"fish\", \"Hello World\", or \"12345\"."," ","Boolean",": A boolean is a value that is either true or false. In the Object Editor Variables window, this is simply shown as a box that you check for true and uncheck for false."," ","Expression",": An expression is a mathematical phrase that can contain ordinary numbers, variables, strings, or GML functions as well as one or more operators. For example ","sqrt(85 * 6) + 5.5"," is an expression."," ","Resource",": A resource is simply any one of the resources that you have defined in the Asset Browser.
