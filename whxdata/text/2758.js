In fact, constant values ","cannot be changed after they have been declared",". This makes them ideal for holding values that are used throughout the game to identify special data."," ","In the GameMaker Language there are two types of user-defined constants: ","macros"," and ","enums",", both of which are explained below. Also note that any value that is always the same is classed as a constant, regardless of the ","data type",", for example, a string or the number 3."," ","NOTE"," The GameMaker Language also has a number of built-in constant values that are used to identify specific things.

Basically, a macro is a named variable that holds an expression. You can define your own macros using the ","Script Editor"," and then use them in your code and actions as if they were regular variables, with the one difference being that they ","can't be changed in the game","."," ","The syntax structure for a macro is as follows:"," ","#macro ","<NAME>"," ","<VALUE>"," ","For example, say you define the following macro \"","TOTAL_WEAPONS","\":"," ","#macro TOTAL_WEAPONS 10"," ","Macro syntax..."," ","The syntax shown above must be used correctly to define macros. You cannot use an equal sign (like in variables) or put a semicolon at the end (like in a regular statement). Doing so will cause your macro definition to become invalid."," ","\n    For example, this is not the correct way to define a macro:"," ","#macro TOTAL_WEAPONS = 10;"," ","\n    Removing the equal sign and colon will make it a valid macro definition."," ","NOTE"," The recommended GML naming conventions recommend ","UPPERCASE_NAMING"," for constants, however you can use lower case or any other naming conventions you like.\n  "," ","You could then use this in your code like this:"," ","pos++;"," ","\n    if (pos >= TOTAL_WEAPONS)","\n    {","\n        pos = 0;","\n    }\n  "," ","Note that you would not be able to change the constant's value, so code like this will cause the game to crash:"," ","TOTAL_WEAPONS = 11;"," ","You can define a macro anywhere in your code or in a script and it will be ","pre-compiled"," and included in your game as if it was there from the start, but we recommend that you create a dedicated script asset and define all your macros in there. It will be easier to organise and debug later!"],[" ","If you need the value of a macro to change at run-time then you should probably make it a ","global variable",", since these can be changed from code during a game, unless you set the macro to be a ","runtime function"," or any ","expression",". By setting the macro to a function/expression it means that this function/expression will be called every time you use the macro. For example:"," ","#macro COL make_colour_hsv(irandom(255), 255, 255)"," ","You would then call this macro something like this:"," ","image_blend = COL;"," ","Using this code will make the image blend a different colour every time the macro is used. It is worth noting that you can also split macros over multiple lines using the ","\\"," character to show where the line breaks are. An example would be something like:"," ","#macro HELLO show_debug_message(\"Hello\" + \\","\n    string(player_name) + \\","\n    \", how are you today?\");"," ","This is purely cosmetic, in that splitting a macro like this will have no effect over the result of the final macro when used, and is simply to provide support for multi-line text on macros that have longer lines of code."],[" ","One very important feature of macros is that they can be defined for use with specific ","Configurations",", meaning you can override the value of a macro when running in a given configuration."," ","For example, say you have a configuration for Android ads and another for iOS ads, then you could define a single macro to hold the required app ID value, and override it for each configuration:"," ","#macro AD_ID \"\"","\n    #macro Android:AD_ID \"com.yoyogames.googlegame\"","\n    #macro iOS:AD_ID \"com.yoyogames.appstoregame\""," ","Configurations do not necessarily have to be named after a platform. You might e.g. also have a specific configuration for a demo version of your game: "," ","#macro DemoVersion:AD_ID \"\""," ","As you can see, you give the config name first then a colon ",":"," and then the macro name and override value. Note that you cannot have any white-space between the colon ",":"," and either the config name nor the macro name otherwise you will get an error."," ","Macro overrides are inherited by child configurations. Say you have the following configuration set-up:"," ","Here, any macro overrides set for ","MobileAds"," will be inherited by ","MobileNoAds",", and you can override an inherited value by setting a macro for that child configuration."],[" ","An enum is an \"enumerator\"; it essentially permits you to create your own limited data type with a list of constant values. They have the following structure:"," ","enum ","<NAME>","\n    {"," ","    <MEMBER>"," [= ","<VALUE>","],"," ","    <","MEMBER",">"," [= ","<","VALUE",">","],","\n        // etc...","\n    }\n  "," ","In the following example, we create an enum for the colours of the rainbow and assign it various constants and default values:"," ","enum RAINBOW","\n    {","\n        RED,","\n        ORANGE,","\n        YELLOW,","\n        GREEN,","\n        BLUE,","\n        INDIGO,","\n        VIOLET","\n    }"," ","The enum entries can only be ","integer numbers"," or ","expression","s"," with previous enums that evaluate to an integer number",", and by default are numbered from 0 upwards, so our example given above would default to ","RED = 0",", ","ORANGE = 1",", ","YELLOW = 2",", etc..."," ","You can also assign values to the enum variables at the time of creation:"," ","enum ENUM_TEST","\n    {","\n        VAL = 10","\n    }"," ","\n    enum RAINBOW","\n    {","\n        RED = 5,","\n        ORANGE = 5 * 2,","\n        YELLOW = 15,","\n        GREEN = 20,","\n        BLUE = 25,","\n        INDIGO = 30,","\n        VIOLET = 35 * ENUM_TEST.VAL","\n    }\n  "," ","Notice in the above example we use another enum to create an expression for \"VIOLET\". This only works if the enum being referenced was created ","before"," the enum that is using it in an expression, but it will not work for variables or functions, since the enum value must be able to be evaluated as a constant when the project is ","Compiling",". Also note that all enum values evaluate to ","integer"," values, and when you create your own you should be aware that ","only integer values are permitted"," for enums to work.
